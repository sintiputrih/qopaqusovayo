Whether it's some bedside selfies with wacky facial expressions or a clip of him getting on her nerves, it's all been very adorable to see. Of course, the social media star is living quite lavishly these days, so we're happy that she got to take the little one along for the ride most of the time. Her time with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">her new boo</a> Moneybagg Yo has been great for them, and even her past romantic relationships are still solid.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, the most notable of these is <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>G Herbo</a>, whom the 28-year-old co-parents Yosohn with. However, she had to go on Instagram Live to address some fans that think she shaded the rapper quite harshly as of late. Apparently, this stems from something that Ari Fletcher did or said on her BET show The Impact: Atlanta that might've thrown him under the bus. She maintained, though, that they simply had a disagreement and worked it out, and that it's a question of accountability rather than shade.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-yosohn-shines-in-new-ig-pics-tiktok-clip>Yosohn Shines In New IG Pics & TikTok Clip</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"How am I mean to him?" Ari Fletcher's message began. "Because I'm holding him accountable? I feel like if I don't hold him accountable, then who else will? My son can't do it, you know what I'm saying? It's just holding him accountable. It's not a bad thing. You know what I'm saying? It's not like we were arguing. We just had a small disagreement, and then we talked about it. You know, just fixed it like adults. I expressed how I felt, he expressed how he felt, we understood where each other was coming from. And then boom, that's how you co-parent. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">That's a healthy co-parenting relationship</a>. There's nothing wrong with that conversation that we had at all. I don't feel like it was hostile or, like, 'B***h!' Them days are over.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ari-fletcher-addresses-g-herbo-relationship>Ari Fletcher Addresses G Herbo Relationship</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"It was like a 'heated conversation' but it wasn't like... I'm just stern," she continued. "I'm gonna express how I feel regardless of who I'm talking to, so... you know? 'That's how it works,' see, exactly! If you know me, you know that's not me cursing you out. If I curse somebody out... nah, that's very shallow. That was me talking, like, firm, and just expressing myself. I don't feel like I was being aggressive at all. 'What Herb said about the interview?' He didn't say nothing about the interview, y'all keep saying that. It was nothing."

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnZ4F1gZBmmKuhXZu5psDCoZyrZamkwLC0zWaqqKZdnru0wMCgqZqlXZx6qbHRm6ZmoJmleqm7z2alnq%2Bj</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f724451-ari-fletcher-yosohn-son-instagram-g-herbo-hip-hop-news.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f724451-ari-fletcher-yosohn-son-instagram-g-herbo-hip-hop-news.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f724451-ari-fletcher-yosohn-son-instagram-g-herbo-hip-hop-news.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f724451-ari-fletcher-yosohn-son-instagram-g-herbo-hip-hop-news.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f724451-ari-fletcher-yosohn-son-instagram-g-herbo-hip-hop-news.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f724451-ari-fletcher-yosohn-son-instagram-g-herbo-hip-hop-news.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./linda-lee-cadwell.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./linda-lee-cadwell.html>Linda Lee Cadwell</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./house-of-the-dragon-books-series-character-guide-html.html>Whos Who in Westeros: A House of the Dragon Character Guide</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./house-of-the-dragon-books-series-character-guide-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
