And the same can be said about Grimes' personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First, Grimes was pregnant with Musk's child, or as she liked to call it – was “knocked up.” Then, the pair gave everyone a collective headache with the bizarre name they chose for their son (X Æ A-12). Then they broke up and the news hit the stands of <a href=#>Musk having twins with his new girlfriend (and Neuralink employee)</a>.</p><p>Then Musk and Grimes were back together again – kind of – in what Grimes called a 'fluid relationship that she doesn't expect others to understand'. And then they randomly announced one day that they <a href=#>just had a second child via surrogate</a>, quickly followed by another announcement that they had “broken up again.”</p><p>The pair sure knows how to give the public vertigo!</p><p>So given all this, it's no secret that Grimes and Elon Musk's relationship is quite different from his relationships with the other women in his past. And one big difference is how Grimes refused to use Musk's money when they were together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Or, at least, that's what she said.</p><h2 id=grimes-39-fans-were-very-upset-when-she-started-dating-elon-musk>Grimes' Fans Were Very Upset When She Started Dating Elon Musk</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-1-7.jpg><p>Grimes has always espoused left-leaning beliefs.

Musk even kept pushing her to “go platinum” regarding her hair color.</p><p>This account sounds very different from the way Grimes describes her relationship with Musk and how he is different from other power-hungry billionaires.</p><p>As for Grimes not accepting any money from Musk while she was with him: While that may be true (no one can know for sure), her career wildly benefited from Musk's larger fan following.</p><p>That has probably increased her personal net worth significantly compared to when she was only an underground subcultural phenomenon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdnL%2BqucSsZK2Zm5p6rrvNnrBmnqKkum6xy6ilZqWlqLhw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-grimes-take-money-from-elon-musk.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-grimes-take-money-from-elon-musk.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-grimes-take-money-from-elon-musk.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-grimes-take-money-from-elon-musk.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-grimes-take-money-from-elon-musk.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-grimes-take-money-from-elon-musk.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lanaryu-talus-plateau-dragon-tear-location-in-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-totk.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lanaryu-talus-plateau-dragon-tear-location-in-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-totk.html>Lanaryu Talus Plateau Dragon Tear Location in Zelda Tears of the Kingdom (TOTK)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./benq-vw2420-monitor-review.html>Brightness and Contrast - BenQ VW2420H Monitor Review</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./benq-vw2420-monitor-review.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
