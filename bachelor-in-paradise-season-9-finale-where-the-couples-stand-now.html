<time>04 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> season 9 was full of drama, but three couples came out stronger than the rest.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Aven Jones</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kylee Russell</strong></a> had an immediate connection when they arrived at the beach in Mexico and appeared to still be going strong as <a href=#>the season finale</a> aired on Thursday, December 7.</p><p>When they got down to the nitty-gritty decisions, however, the duo had different ideas for the future of their relationship. While Kylee, 26, was looking for an engagement, Aven, 30, wanted to spend more time together outside of the <a href=#>Bachelor Nation</a> bubble before getting down on one knee.</p><p>“Why is it [that] an engagement, specifically, is the only way to where you’re going to believe that I see a future with you?” Aven asked Kylee during one candid conversation. Kylee, for her part, made it clear Aven was “The One” for her, so she didn’t understand why they weren’t “on the same page” regarding an engagement.</p><p>“I feel like we’re in a really good spot,” Aven countered, noting that he’s “never been happier” in a relationship. Kylee’s “energy shift” was still noticeable.</p><p>“This is the first time in a long time I’ve been really, really sure about somebody and I’m trying my best to consider what she’s feeling. I know that she wants an engagement out of this, but if I were to do that and things didn’t work out, I would regret that for the rest of my life,” Aven explained in his confessional. “As much as I believe in Paradise, I can’t not compare it to shifting the same dynamics in the real world. I can’t do it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Where-Do-the-Final-Couples-From-Bachelor-in-Paradise-Season-9-Stand-Now-1.jpg><p>In the end, Aven and Kylee agreed that they didn’t want to “lose” each other over an argument and <a href=#>left the beach as a couple</a> — without <a href=#>an engagement</a>.</p><p>Fellow season 9 couple <strong>Eliza Isichei</strong> and <strong>Aaron Bryant</strong> had fewer questions when it came to the status of their relationship. The duo expressed their love for each other, participated in an overnight date and <a href=#>left Paradise engaged</a>.</p><p>“I definitely could see myself spending the rest of my life with Eliza,” Aaron, 30, said during the finale. “It’s giving forever.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Where-Do-the-Final-Couples-From-Bachelor-in-Paradise-Season-9-Stand-Now-2.jpg><p>Joining them as the <a href=#>second engaged couple</a> of the season was <strong>John Henry Spurlock</strong> and <strong>Kat Izzo</strong>.</p><p>“Being with you, it feels like it’s a love that only comes once in a lifetime,” Kat, 27, told John Henry, 31, before he proposed. “Just know that I love you John Henry and I want to forever.”</p><p>Did these three couples stay together after leaving the beach? Keep scrolling for a status update on each duo:</p><h3>Aven Jones and Kylee Russell</h3><p>“Kylee’s patience paid off, and she and Aven have blossomed as a couple,” read text on the screen during the Thursday night finale as sweet photos of the duo were shown. “It’s nothing but [fire emoji] from here on out.”</p><p class=p1>Kylee announced on December 9 that <a href=#><span class=s1>the pair had split </span></a>after she discovered “multiple infidelities.” One day later, Aven <a href=#>apologized to Kylee</a> for his actions via an Instagram Story statement, writing, “I have made major mistakes in the relationship and hurt someone who was very close to me.”</p><p class=p1>He continued: “At this time, I am in an extremely, extremely low place trying to work on myself. I am doing my best to find healing, find myself and be a better person. Please have grace and respect for Kylee and her family through this difficult time.”</p><h3>Eliza Isichei and Aaron Bryant</h3><p>“Aaron and Eliza’s engagement has hit some speed bumps since they left the beach,” their status update revealed. “They are actively working on their relationship and trying to figure things out.”</p><p>Four days after the BiP finale aired, Aaron announced via his Instagram Story that he and Eliza had <a href=#>ended their relationship</a>. “We’re leading our amicable split with nothing but positivity and mutual respect for one another,” he wrote on December 11. “Thank you all 🖤.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Where-Do-the-Final-Couples-From-Bachelor-in-Paradise-Season-9-Stand-Now-3.jpg><h3>John Henry Spurlock and Kat Izzo</h3><p>According to the pair’s onscreen update during the season 9 finale, Kat and John Henry were “moving to San Diego and planning a happy life together.” However, they <a href=#>announced their split</a> days after the finale in a joint <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> post.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Our relationship has been filled with wonderful memories and growth, something we looked forward to sharing with you,” the exes’ statement read. “While our paths are taking different directions due to our career goals not aligning, we are grateful for the love and support we’ve received from our family, friends, and Bachelor Nation. While this decision wasn’t easy, we believe it’s the right step for both of us as individuals.”</p><p>John Henry later <a href=#>clarified</a> via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> that he didn’t feel like he “made a mistake” in proposing to Kat, adding that he “fell for the real Kat Izzo.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmam5iaubC%2BjKKlZqiRp66ltdKeZKydkai8r3mYZp2ippGhsm7Dx56pnmWknbJur86up6Wdo2LAta3NnWSnp6dk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbachelor-in-paradise-season-9-finale-where-the-couples-stand-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbachelor-in-paradise-season-9-finale-where-the-couples-stand-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbachelor-in-paradise-season-9-finale-where-the-couples-stand-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbachelor-in-paradise-season-9-finale-where-the-couples-stand-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbachelor-in-paradise-season-9-finale-where-the-couples-stand-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbachelor-in-paradise-season-9-finale-where-the-couples-stand-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./amy-jackson-net-worth-details-about-film-income-husband-age-career.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./amy-jackson-net-worth-details-about-film-income-husband-age-career.html>Amy Jackson Net Worth: Details About Film, Income, Husband, Age, Career - SarkariResult</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-is-kevin-durant-not-playing-tonight-who-is-kevin-durant.html>Why is Kevin Durant Not Playing Tonight?
