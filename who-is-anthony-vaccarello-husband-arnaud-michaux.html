Vaccarello once told <a href=# rel=noopener>Vogue</a> that no matter how many people work in the YSL atelier during the day, by the end of the day, it's always only the two of them together, alone.</p><h4>Arnaud Michaux and Anthony Vaccarello First Met In Art School</h4><p>Anthony Vaccarello and Arnaud Michaux first met at Brussels' La Cambre art school in 2003 and began dating right away (<a href=# rel=noopener>Vogue</a>).</p><p>&nbsp;Vaccarello, the son of Sicilian parents, had ended up there after a two-year failed attempt to study law.

Sometimes they're twinning in shoes, sometimes sitting on a beach watching the sunset, and sometimes he is trolling him on a baby trolley.</p><p>You can explore cute pictures of the father and son duo on Anthony's Instagram.</p><h2 id=anthony-vaccarellos-net-w>Anthony Vaccarello's Net Worth, How Rich Is The Fashion Designer?</h2><p>Anthony Vaccarello is a fashion designer who has a net worth of <strong>$10 million</strong> as of 2022.</p><p>He might have made a fortune as a creative director at Saint Laurent.

If there was ever a line about what constitutes a "masculine" wardrobe and what makes clothes "feminine," it has been elegantly blurred here.</p><p>New collar and shoulder solutions, single and double-breasted options, and a suave yet modern cream iteration of the tux in lightweight silk faille are among the exciting options.&nbsp;A prominent high waist and wide leg create an elongated shape, occasionally broken up by narrow or boxy accents. The silhouettes are more relaxed overall, reflecting the Marrakech way of life (<a href=# rel=noopener>Union Square</a>).</p><p>Outer pieces are looser, more fluid, and less constructed: gathered satin coats envelop the body almost to the ground, whereas tailored jackets are graphically sharp.</p><table class="table table-bordered content-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Valentino Garavani</strong></td><td>$1.5 Billion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Christian Candy</strong></td><td>$1.1 Billion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Stefano Gabbana</strong></td><td>$1.7 Billion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Domenico Dolce</strong></td><td>$1.7 Billion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Patrizio Bertelli</strong></td><td>$5.2 Billion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ralph Lauren</strong></td><td>$8.2 Billion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Giorgio Armani</strong></td><td>$9.6 Billion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Miuccia Prada</strong></td><td>$11.1 Billion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong></td><td>$19 Billion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Designer</strong></td><td>Net Worth</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tim Sweeney</strong></td><td>$8 Billion</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Some FAQs</h2><h3 class=m-0>Who is the creative director at Saint Laurent?</h3>Anthony Vaccarello is the creative director at Saint Laurent.<h3 class=m-0>What is the net worth of Anthony Vaccarello?</h3>Anthony Vaccarello has an estimated net worth between $5 million to $10 million.<h3 class=m-0>Who is Arnaud Michaux?</h3>Arnaud Michaux is also a fashion designer who works alongside his husband, Anthony ta Saint Laurent.<h3 class=m-0>How old is Anthony Vaccarello?</h3>Anthony Vaccarello turned 40 on 19 January 2022.<h3 class=m-0>Who is Anthony Vaccarello's husband?</h3>Anthony Vaccarello is married to his husband, Arnaud Michaux since October 2016.<h3 class=m-0>Does Anthony Vaccarello has a child?</h3>Yes, Anthony Vaccarello and Arnaud Michaux has a son, Luca.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirmKTEo7XZnKarppWne6S7zGiuoaddnsBurc2tn6imqWLDoq%2FCmqmepJykeqnB0puYp5xdlr%2BvrdSdZKahk52utsQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-anthony-vaccarello-husband-arnaud-michaux.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-anthony-vaccarello-husband-arnaud-michaux.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-anthony-vaccarello-husband-arnaud-michaux.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-anthony-vaccarello-husband-arnaud-michaux.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-anthony-vaccarello-husband-arnaud-michaux.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-anthony-vaccarello-husband-arnaud-michaux.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./inside-jennifer-lopez-ben-afflecks-miami-vacation-pad-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./inside-jennifer-lopez-ben-afflecks-miami-vacation-pad-photos.html>Inside Jennifer Lopez, Ben Afflecks Miami Vacation Pad: Photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./madison-lecroy-fiance-brett-randle-net-worth-spending-southern-comfort.html>The Truth About Madison LeCroy And Her Husband's Combined Net Worth And What They Do With All Their</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./madison-lecroy-fiance-brett-randle-net-worth-spending-southern-comfort.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
