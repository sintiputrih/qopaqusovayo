Breaking form with typical Hollywood biographies, I, Tonya is packaged as a kind of documentary, with contradictory confessional interviews by Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan) and Harding (Margot Robbie) driving the story forward. The format gives the movie a true-to-life feel while trafficking in events that feel too absurd to be real. So what in I, Tonya, is accurate, and what can be chalked up to artistic license? For your convenience, Vulture has assembled a fact-checked guide to most significant moments in I, Tonya, a movie that manages to be as sensational as it is faithful to historical events.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb2jcswp000p3h5z7n3n0bat@published data-word-count=87><strong>Was Harding really forced to pee on the ice because her mom refused to give her bathroom breaks?</strong><br>According to <a href=#>a woman who took lessons</a> at the same rink as Harding during that time, Tonya’s mother, <a href=#>LaVona Golden, did shout at her daughter</a>, “I paid for you to practice, so you’re going to stay on the ice and practice.” In a Chicago Tribune article from 1994, this policy did mean that Harding was sometimes was forced to urinate on the ice, according to people who knew her then.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb2jcu78001f3h5zxzjjs1i5@published data-word-count=52><strong>Did LaVona hit Harding with a hairbrush?</strong><br>A woman named Antje Spethmann, who skated with Harding until they were 13, <a href=#>told the New York Times</a> in 1994 that she did see that take place.

I have proof of that one, too.”</p><h2 class=related-stories-title data-editable=title>Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-jWZcHiUn"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>I, Tonya Turns Tonya Harding From a Punch Line Into a Sympathetic Character</span></a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb2jct5a000u3h5z777xqgy1@published data-word-count=9><strong>Did a young Harding wear a homemade rabbit-fur coat?</strong><br>Unverified.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb2jct58000s3h5zt8m5sh76@published data-word-count=174><strong>Did Shawn Eckhardt really claim to be a counterterrorism expert?</strong><br>Oh, yes. The interview with Diane Sawyer from 1994 is as weird as you’d expect, with Sawyer <a href=#>explaining to viewers</a> that, “Eckhardt has a résumé that makes him out to be a cross between James Bond and Oliver North, and before the attack on Kerrigan he reportedly bragged about dangerous exploits, including the fact that he had hit men.” Sawyer asked Eckhardt if he was the one who was “power mad” and “megalomaniacal,” and if he actually manufactured the entire scheme to fulfill a “deranged fantasy.” Eckhardt assured her, “My training and education has been in the areas of counterespionage and counterterrorism. I’ve done extensive research in the areas of terrorism trends and profiles. I’ve been quoted as an expert in terrorism trends and profiles.” He attributes that quote to a “travel magazine a couple of years ago during the Gulf War.” Sawyer’s incredulity at Eckhardt’s is outstanding to watch, especially when he says he got started in his “trade” at the age of 17.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb2jct59000t3h5zr0uich7h@published data-word-count=88>In the movie, Eckhardt is presented as reveling in the footage of Kerrigan’s attack being broadcast on TV, but in his interview with Sawyer, he says that footage was what made him flip on Gillooly, because he was filled with so much guilt about participating in her attack. Eckhardt also claimed that he <a href=#>basically protected Kerrigan</a> by insisting to Gillooly she didn’t need to be murdered to solve their problem. “There’s other things you can do to disable somebody,” he told Sawyer. “You don’t need to kill them.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb2jctde000v3h5z3ohqfwa3@published data-word-count=72><strong>Did Tonya tell a judge to “suck my dick” after the judge criticized her outfit?</strong><br>No. Robbie said <a href=#>in a late-night interview</a> that the line was made up, but that when Harding saw the movie, she apparently wished she had said it. Harding did, however, tell the judge who criticized her outfit that unless she could come up with $5,000 to buy Harding a new costume she could “stay out of my face.”</p><h2 class=related-stories-title data-editable=title>Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-j4qKemja"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>Best Actress Watch: Can Margot Robbie Skate to Gold As Tonya Harding?</span></a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb2jctdg000y3h5zpm7u6orf@published data-word-count=224><strong>What happened with Tonya and her half-brother?</strong><br>Harding’s half-brother, whom she calls “creepy Chris” in the movie, was actually named Chris Davidson, and he did sexually assault her in their home when she was 15 and he was 26. In the movie, Harding quickly fends him off and leaves him on the ground, but the real-life events are much more frightening. As Harding prepared for her first date with Gillooly, Davidson tried to kiss her, and she threatened to burn him with her curling iron if he kept advancing. Davidson continued to force himself on her, so she set the iron to his neck, ran to the upstairs bathroom, and locked herself inside. According to Harding’s account, he then followed her and beat the door down, but she was able to get away and call the police. He continued to pursue her, though, so she hit him with a hockey stick and ran to a neighbor’s house. Davidson was arrested later that night and spent several years in jail. Shortly after his release <a href=#>he was killed by a hit-and-run driver</a>, and Harding told <a href=#>Sports Illustrated </a>in 1992 that she did not attend the funeral. Of the incident, Harding’s mom said, “I wouldn’t put it past Chris to try and get a kiss. Tonya has a vivid imagination. She has a tendency to tell tall tales.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb2jctdf000x3h5zfc4f913k@published data-word-count=107><strong>Did Gillooly slam Harding’s hand in a car door?</strong><br>According to Harding, yes. In the movie, it happens fast, when the two are having an argument by their car, but in The Tonya Tapes, Harding says she was fleeing the house to escape Gillooly beating her up when he ran to their car and pulled a coil out of the engine to keep her from driving away. As she was exiting the car, Harding says Gillooly kicked the door shut and it completely closed with her hand in it. At that point, Harding says she grabbed the bag she had brought outside with her, and ran from Gillooly.</p><h2 class=related-stories-title data-editable=title>Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-JJS8xcpa"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>Allison Janney Is a Cursing, Bird-Owning, Chain-Smoking Revelation in&nbsp;I, Tonya</span></a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb2jctde000w3h5zc2ndt9se@published data-word-count=74><strong>Did Harding chase Gillooly out of their house with a shotgun?</strong><br>Robbie’s version of Harding breaks the fourth wall in I, Tonya to assure the audience she did not fire a gun at Gillooly as he ran away from her, and while the real Tonya does not reference that event specifically, she does say in The Tonya Tapes that Gillooly once threatened her with a shotgun.

Rawlinson described the transition to <a href=#>Sports Illustrated</a> as follows: “The bottom line is, it wasn’t working.” She added, “Tonya wasn’t training, and wasn’t meeting the goals she had set for herself. So I delegated her to Dody.” In The Tonya Tapes, Harding also makes it sound like an amicable arrangement, saying, “I thought I knew more. It wasn’t working out. We both decided I would go over to Dody, who was Diane’s very first student, and let her work with me.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb2jctq600143h5zo5erqsjs@published data-word-count=122><strong>Is the scene behind the diner with Rawlinson and Harding really how the latter started coaching her again?</strong><br>No. Harding says in The Tonya Tapes that she approached Rawlinson and asked her to come back and coach her again, and that she did it at the behest of Gillooly. “I went to her and asked her to take me back. And it took a lot, too,” Harding said, adding that in a meeting with Rawlinson and Gillooly she promised, “I will do this, and do this, and do this, and this — twist myself into a pretzel for you,” to convince Rawlinson to come back. Based on accounts given in ESPN’s The Price of Gold, Rawlinson did indeed dislike Harding’s blue nail polish.</p><h2 class=related-stories-title data-editable=title>Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-0AfAZ5LG"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>I, Tonya’s Filmmakers on Their Controversial Treatment of Domestic Violence</span></a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb2jctpy00113h5zdol1bnzb@published data-word-count=44><strong>Did Harding and Kerrigan room together on tour and get wasted in hotels?</strong><br>It doesn’t seem like it.

In The Tonya Tapes, she describes a similar incident to what happens in I, Tonya, even if it’s not exactly the same. According to the book, Gillooly had broken into Harding’s apartment and taken her purse to coerce her into talking to him. She unsuccessfully tried to get it back from him outside her building, and Gillooly chased her back into her apartment, where she says he threatened to shoot himself and shoot her. She then left her home, walked to the parking lot, and Gillooly shot in her direction, hitting the pavement and causing an errant piece of asphalt to fly up and hit her in the face. The subsequent police encounter is then described as a chase that ended when two cop cars boxed Gillooly in and forced him to pull over. Harding says they were then both forced to get out of the car, and that even though the police confiscated Gillooly’s gun and shotgun, they let him go without charges and allowed him to take Harding home.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb2jctq600153h5z0r5o8js6@published data-word-count=28><strong>Did Gillooly make a marathon drive from Portland, Oregon, to Idaho just to scream “Fuck you!” at Tonya after an argument?</strong><br>Unverified, but this one seems like artistic license.</p><h2 class=related-stories-title data-editable=title>Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-xPXaYWc8"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>Allison Janney Goes for the Gold</span></a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb2jctq500133h5ziw4epirj@published data-word-count=124><strong>Did LaVona try to record Harding making incriminating statements?</strong><br>According to Harding, yes, but not in her home like it’s presented in I, Tonya.

Saunders encouraged his friend to turn himself in, and eventually went to the FBI with what Eckhardt told him.
