<time>19 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Derek Lewiston: is he in jail? Find out the latest on the divisive and controversial person at the center of the contentious rhino horn trade dispute.</strong></p><p>On December 15, 2023, Derek Lewitton, the owner of Black Rock Rhino Conservation in South Africa and a well-known figure in the rhino conservation community, was placed under arrest.</p><p>He is accused of being involved in the illegal rhino horn trafficking.</p><p>Interestingly, Lewitton has been a vocal supporter of legalizing the trade in rhino horn, claiming that doing so could stop the species from going extinct.</p><p>However, when authorities found several rhino carcasses on his property, their arrest took an unexpected turn. Sadly, it seemed as though some of these dead animals had lost their horns.</p><p>The precarious equilibrium between conservation policies and legal frameworks has been clouded by the circumstances, which has caused tremors in the conservation community.</p><h2>Is Derek Lewitton Getting Charged With Killing Rhinos? Case Report?</h2><p>The South African Police Service (SAPS) reports that Lewitton was taken into custody alongside two other individuals who were recognized as his workers.</p><p>During the operation, the SAPS reported that they had taken control of a vehicle, a gun, ammo, and twelve rhino horns.</p><p>Additionally, they claimed to have discovered proof of a covert lab where the horns were prepared for export.</p><p>On December 18, 2023, Lewitton and his accomplice made an appearance at the Tzaneen Magistrate’s Court, where they were accused of violating the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEMBA).</p><p>Without permission, it is illegal to import, export, or even own rhino horns. They were also accused of possessing a gun and ammo illegally.</p><p>They were remanded in custody until their next appearance on January 15, 2024, after the court granted them bail.</p><p>An item in a related category: Are Aimee Drescher and France Plane victims of human trafficking? Death Hoax Disproved</p><p>Advocate Thabo Mokoena, Lewitton’s attorney, asserted that his client was innocent and that he possessed all the required licenses to keep and dehorn rhinos on his reserve.</p><p>He said that anti-trade groups had launched a smear campaign against Lewiston in an attempt to undermine his efforts to protect rhinos.</p><p>Additionally, he stated that Lewitton had been assisting the authorities and had voluntarily given the SAPS the horns from the deceased rhinos so they could conduct DNA testing.</p><h2>Derek Lewitton Allegations Made In 2023</h2><p>Lewitton finds himself at the center of a legal maze that could result in a ten-year prison sentence.</p><p>Severe penalties for violations about rhino conservation are stipulated in the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEMBA).</p><p>In particular, anyone convicted of illegally possessing, trading, or exporting rhino horns faces a hefty fine of up to R10 million, a possible 10-year jail sentence, or both.</p><p>The Act further emphasizes the seriousness of having illegal weapons or ammunition, with fines of up to 15 years in prison.</p><p>Following Lewitton’s imprisonment, campaigners, conservationist groups, and the general public have all become enraged about rhino preservation tactics.</p><p>Both proponents and opponents have embraced Lewitton’s perspective, which holds that allowing the trade in rhino horn might reduce demand in the black market and direct money toward conservation.</p><p>Supporters think that this strategy might prevent incentives for poaching.</p><p>On the other hand, some worry that legalization will increase the appeal of rhino products, increasing the pace of poaching and jeopardizing efforts to reduce demand, particularly in important consumer countries like China and Vietnam.</p><p>The story emphasizes how difficult it is to conserve animals and how urgently comprehensive, successful approaches are needed.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
