He has mentioned his love for her in several of his tracks, including 'You and The 6', 'Look What You've Done' and 'The Calm' among others. Keeping up with the same energy, the rapper took to social media to share a few photos from Graham's 75th birthday. He was seen with his five-year-old son, Adonis, and his father, Dennis. He also wrote a heartfelt caption while sharing the images.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=# rel>'One Dance' rapper</a> wrote, "Thank you mama for the 9 months you carried me through‚Ä¶all the pain and suffering. No one knows the pressure you bear just only you‚Ä¶give you all my love." However, this is not the first time the rapper has expressed his love for his mother. Back in 2012, he got a tattoo of Graham's initials above his left eye. He even shared a touching tribute with his Instagram family of over 130 million followers. The rapper was seen with his son while wearing a light gray suit, white shirt and shiny jewelry to compliment his outfit. Adonis also sported a similar outfit with a gray suit and a white shirt with his hair slicked back in cornrows. In a heartwarming snap, Adonis could be seen with his grandmother blowing the candles. The three were then snapped in a picture with <a href=# rel>Drake's father</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Drake gets honest about watching porn, dating and marriage in 'no filter' conversation with Howard Stern</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Never met.

His mother, Sandra "Sandi" Graham, is a Canadian Ashkenazi Jew, who worked as an English teacher and florist. The two first met in Toronto when Dennis performed at Club Bluenote. Dennis and Graham parted ways when Drake was only five. Post the separation, Dennis returned to Memphis. There, he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges. Due to his limited finances and legal constraints, Dennis could not make trips to Toronto.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/095a83e0-e177-49e9-9f3b-279dec06dc56.png><p>Drake has had a controversial relationship with his father. It got strenuous after Dennis reportedly claimed that the rapper lied about their relationships in songs just to "sell records." Dennis told Power 106 Los Angeles radio host Nick Cannon, "I have always been with Drake. I talk to him, if not every day, every other day. And we really got into a deep conversation about that. I said, ‚ÄòDrake, why are you saying all this different stuff about me, man? This is not cool.'" Drake reportedlt responded, "Dad, it sells records." Drake, at the time, replied via an Instagram story saying, "Woke up today so hurt man. My father will say anything to anyone that‚Äôs willing to listen to him. It‚Äôs sad when family gets like this but what can we really do?" However, it looks like two kept their issues aside to celebrate Graham's birthday.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>'Dope family pic'</h2><p>Several people chimed in after seeing the rapper with his family.
