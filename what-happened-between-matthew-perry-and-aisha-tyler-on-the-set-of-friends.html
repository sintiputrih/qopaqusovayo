His considerate nature behind the scenes on the set of Friends and in life in general might have often gone unnoticed, but they left a lasting impact on those around him.</p><p>Perry’s support for guest stars like John Stamos exemplified his generous nature. When Stamos faced a lukewarm response from the live audience during his appearance on the famous NBC sitcom, Perry took swift action. <a href=#>Going out of his way, the Chandler Bing actor ensured that Stamos received the applause</a> and recognition he deserved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/matt-leblanc-refused-to-answer-a-question-about-a-problematic-matthew-perry-storyline-on-friends-front-instar-back-friends-poster-show.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Matt LeBlanc Refused To Answer A Question About A Problematic Matthew Perry Storyline On Friends">Matt LeBlanc Refused To Answer A Question About A Problematic Matthew Perry Storyline On Friends</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Friends had some controversial storylines in the past, but Matt LeBlanc refused to agree with the criticism against the show years later.</p><p>Away from the world of Friends, Family Ties star Michael J. Fox also once revealed how, after negotiating a groundbreaking contract alongside his Friends co-stars, <a href=#>Perry quietly made a substantial donation to The Michael J. Fox Foundation</a> for Parkinson’s Research. In following this same pattern, Tyler reminisced about her time on the show, fondly recalling how spot on <a href=#>Perry was with his pep talk to her</a> during her inaugural appearance in the series.</p><h2 id=matthew-perry-encouraged-aisha-tyler-on-the-set-of-friends>Matthew Perry Encouraged Aisha Tyler On The Set Of Friends</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/aisha-tyler-friends-scene.jpg><p>Aisha Tyler would have likely been on edge before her debut on Friends, but she found encouragement from people’s person, Matthew Perry. Tyler enjoyed a nine-episode arc on the show as a character called Charlie Wheeler. Recalling that first interaction, Tyler vividly recounted Perry’s words of encouragement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The night of my very first live performance in front of a studio audience, as the cast came together at the end of the taping to take a bow in front of the crowd, Matthew Perry made a point of saying to me, ‘Get ready for your life to change, and it did!” she said in a 2022 interview with InStyle magazine.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>4:43</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/the-friends-cast.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Did The Friends Cast Get Along?

This period of the show had seen a parade of high-profile celebrities, each leaving their mark on the series in unique ways.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a>, for instance, appeared in a Thanksgiving episode as Will Colbert, an old schoolmate of Ross and Monica who harbored a comedic grudge against Rachel. Reese Witherspoon was another major guest star on Friends. She played Jill Green, Rachel’s younger sister, in a memorable two-episode arc.</p><p>Tom Selleck, as Monica’s older boyfriend Dr. Richard Burke, was another significant addition. <a href=#><strong>Bruce Willis</strong></a> appeared in a three-episode arc as Paul Stevens, the father of Ross's girlfriend, and his performance earned him an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/matthew-perry-revealed-the-one-strict-rule-the-cast-of-friends-never-dared-to-break.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="A Guest Star On Friends Claims Matthew Perry Made Her Career Because Of Their Storyline On The Show">A Guest Star On Friends Claims Matthew Perry Made Her Career Because Of Their Storyline On The Show</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>A certain star wouldn’t have landed a regular role in Friends, and her iconic role in Criminal Minds, without Matthew Perry’s help.</p><p>Reflecting on her own guest star experience in her InStyle magazine interview, Tyler noted, “The cast was incredibly welcoming when I first joined. This was in season 9 when they had already had several very high-profile guest actors on the show.”</p><h2 id=aisha-tyler-made-history-with-her-role-in-friends>Aisha Tyler Made History With Her Role In Friends</h2><p>Aisha Tyler made television history with her role on Friends, becoming the first Black woman to have a recurring part on the show. A study by National World highlighted a stark disparity in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">racial diversity across the top 20 sitcoms</a> listed on IMDb. Out of these, 11 shows did not feature any people of color in visible roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Among the remaining nine that included diverse casts, only Community and Brooklyn Nine-Nine had more than a third of their main cast made up of people of color, both standing at 44.4%. In the landscape of such skewed representation, Tyler’s role on Friends was a quiet but notable stride towards inclusivity.</p><p>“Honestly, it was a great experience personally and creatively,” she reflected. Even so, the character Charlie Wheeler was integrated into the storyline as Ross’ love interest, without the show making a pointed statement about race.</p><p>“I don’t think that I felt like, even though I knew that was a milestone, I don’t know that I felt like they turned it into something more than what it was, which was just a love interest for Ross,” Tyler added. She appreciated that the storyline did not pivot on her race, suggesting a normalization of interracial relationships on television.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmpZGpwamx1mannqqirnqiusNmmKKrmJZ6tcXLnqlmp55iwamxjKycrWWfm3qnvsiepZ2rXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-between-matthew-perry-and-aisha-tyler-on-the-set-of-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-between-matthew-perry-and-aisha-tyler-on-the-set-of-friends.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-matthew-perry-and-aisha-tyler-on-the-set-of-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-between-matthew-perry-and-aisha-tyler-on-the-set-of-friends.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-matthew-perry-and-aisha-tyler-on-the-set-of-friends.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-matthew-perry-and-aisha-tyler-on-the-set-of-friends.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./asap-rockys-net-worth-in-2023.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./asap-rockys-net-worth-in-2023.html>ASAP Rockys Net Worth in 2023: Unveiling His Financial Success?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./northern-westchester-swim-conference-crowns-2016-champions.html>Northern Westchester Swim Conference Crowns 2016 Champions</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./northern-westchester-swim-conference-crowns-2016-champions.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
