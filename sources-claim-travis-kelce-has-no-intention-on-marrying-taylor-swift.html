Prior to dating Kelce, <strong>Swift was in a brief romance with rock singer Matt Healy</strong> and, before him, she was in a six-year relationship with actor Joe Alwyn. Besides Swift, Kelce's most public relationships have previously been with <strong>sports reporter Kayla Nicole and social media influencer Maya Benberry</strong>.</p><p>While Swift and Kelce have only been dating for a short time, the pair appear to be very much in love. Case in point, the couple were photographed embarking on a romantic rendezvous in Lake Como this past week. The two were even spotted sharing a kiss and going for a stroll hand in hand. As the couple prepares to travel to Italy next for <strong>Taylor Swift's Eras Tour</strong>, rumors have been swirling for months that they could become engaged very soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A source close to the couple recently told Entertainment Tonight, "Taylor and Travis are doing amazing, and their loved ones see an engagement coming sooner than later. They make a great match and there's no question about that."</p><p>However, new reports tell an entirely different story about the future of the superstar couple's relationship.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to an interview with Us Weekly</a>, a source close to Travis Kelce disclosed to the publication that, "Travis has no plans on proposing to Taylor. Another source stated, "It's not even on his radar. Marriage is something he takes very seriously and not something he would ever just jump into without giving it some careful consideration." A separate source claimed that while Kelce 'cares very deeply' about the Bejeweled songstress 'he's just not there yet' when it comes to asking her to marry him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-views-on-marriage>Travis Kelce And Taylor Swift Views On Marriage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-at-coachella.jpg><p>While countless rumors continue to swirl about whether <strong>Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift will become engaged</strong>, the pair have occasionally spoken about their individual views on marriage.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-joe-alwyn.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Joe Alwyn Spotted Chatting With A Bevy Of Women As Taylor Swift's New Romance Gets Serious">Joe Alwyn Spotted Chatting With A Bevy Of Women As Taylor Swift's New Romance Gets Serious</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Joe Alwyn is supposedly enjoying being single while rumors swirl that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce might get engaged soon.</p><p>In an 2012 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Swift relayed that she did want to get married one day and added, “Being a mom full-time, doing everything for my kids, having a bunch of them. One day, I’m sure.“</p><p>As for his own views on marriage, Travis Kelce has largely stayed quiet on the matter. However, a few months ago, he stated that he and Taylor Swift were on the same page when it comes to getting married and that they were not in a rush to walk down the aisle just yet. He added that they were currently enjoying their time together and taking things one step at a time and appreciated the support from the fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqqK2imLK0ecKlmKKlXam%2FosLIrGSknZyYsm60wKxkp6ddnru1sc2toKimXaS7brnAq6myoZ6cerWt2KWmq2WjrLanwI4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsources-claim-travis-kelce-has-no-intention-on-marrying-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsources-claim-travis-kelce-has-no-intention-on-marrying-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsources-claim-travis-kelce-has-no-intention-on-marrying-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsources-claim-travis-kelce-has-no-intention-on-marrying-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsources-claim-travis-kelce-has-no-intention-on-marrying-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsources-claim-travis-kelce-has-no-intention-on-marrying-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jensen-ackles-exhibiting-strong-grandpa-winchester-vibes-during-an-instagram-live.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jensen-ackles-exhibiting-strong-grandpa-winchester-vibes-during-an-instagram-live.html>Jensen Ackles exhibiting strong Grandpa Winchester vibes during an Instagram live is everyones ne</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./erin-little.html>Erin Little KCTV Meteorologist, Age, Wiki, Husband, Married, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./erin-little.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
