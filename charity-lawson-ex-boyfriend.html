In fact, Charity went as far as to compare her ex-boyfriend to <a href=#>Xavier,</a> one of her many suitors and a fan-favorite.</p><p>During the July 17, 2023, episode, Charity selected Xavier for a one-on-one date starting at a fruit festival. Interestingly, while Charity admitted that she and the 27-year-old biomedical scientist have a strong connection, she questions if "he can reach husband level."</p><p>As the date continued, Xavier paid Charity a few compliments about her looks which she appreciated but shared that she wanted him to be interested in her for different reasons</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“We’re having fun. He’s being a great sport at everything,” Charity says in a confessional. “I think why I’m so on edge is Xavier reminds me a little bit of my ex. We have a connection, but is it strong enough? That’s the thing. And I think, will I have that answer by tonight? I’m not sure.”</p><p>Luckily, Xavier got deep about his past relationships at dinner and shared with Charity some of his fears that included "not having his strong feelings reciprocated" and " constantly asking for things he needed" from his ex-girlfriend.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As a result, Charity also opens up about some of her fears, past experiences, and more with Xavier. She discusses her fear of "not being enough and a man cheating on her."

During the night time portion of the date, Charity opened up to Zach telling him that her relationship before going on the show was emotionally abusive. She said, "I never honestly felt what it feels like... to be seen as a girlfriend."</p><p>Charity continued, "It was a relationship that had several occurrences of infidelity... it became this vicious cycle of manipulation." Charity actually went on the Bachelor Happy Hour podcast and opened up even more about her ex and their on-again, off-again six year relationship.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>During the episode, Charity told former Bachelorettes Becca and Michelle that they were high school sweethearts and that she thought that he was "her person." Charity and her ex were on and off during college as well and got back together post undergrad. Charity explained, "It was just a really unhealthy relationship." Charity ended things and finally stood up for herself.</p><p>Charity's ex boyfriend came up even more during Zach and her <a href=#>hometown date</a>. In a private conversation between Charity and her brother, Nehemiah, he asked Charity if she was ready to go through heartbreak again, because he didn't think that she would be OK last time.</p><p>Unfortunately, Charity ended up heartbroken after she was eliminated before Fantasy Suite dates. However, Zach's loss was Charity's gain, since she's in the midst of finding her special someone as the Bachelorette.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Charity Lawson's ex-boyfriend?</h2><p>We practically sleuthed the entire internet to find Charity's ex-boyfriend, but sadly we came up short.
