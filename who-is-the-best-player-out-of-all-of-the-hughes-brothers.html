With three talented brothers - Quinn, Jack, and Luke - all making their mark in the sport, it's natural to wonder who among them is the best player. In this article, we will delve into the strengths, achievements, and potential of each of the Hughes brothers to determine who truly stands out as the top player in the family.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Quinn Hughes</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Quinn Hughes, the eldest of the Hughes brothers, is a defenseman for the Vancouver Canucks in the National Hockey League (NHL). Known for his exceptional skating ability and offensive prowess, Quinn has quickly become a force to be reckoned with in the league. His vision and playmaking skills are remarkable, as evidenced by his ability to control the pace of the game and create scoring opportunities for his team. In the 2019-2020 season, Quinn finished third in the Calder Memorial Trophy voting, which is awarded to the NHL's top rookie.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Jack Hughes</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The middle brother, Jack Hughes, is a center for the New Jersey Devils. Jack was the first overall pick in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft, a testament to his incredible talent and potential. He is known for his lightning-fast speed, exceptional stickhandling, and ability to make quick decisions on the ice. Although Jack's rookie season in the NHL was not as dominant as some had hoped, he has shown flashes of brilliance and is expected to have a long and successful career ahead.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Luke Hughes</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The youngest of the Hughes brothers, Luke Hughes, is an up-and-coming defenseman who is projected to be a top pick in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. Luke possesses a rare combination of size, skill, and hockey IQ, making him an exciting prospect for NHL teams. He is a smooth skater with excellent offensive instincts, much like his older brother Quinn. While Luke is yet to make his mark at the professional level, his potential is undeniable, and he has already impressed scouts and analysts with his performance in junior leagues.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Comparing the Brothers</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>When comparing the Hughes brothers, it's important to consider various factors, including their current performance, achievements, and potential for growth. Each brother brings a unique set of skills to the table, making it difficult to determine an outright winner.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>In terms of immediate impact, Quinn Hughes has already proven himself as an elite defenseman in the NHL. His ability to control the game and contribute offensively sets him apart from his brothers. However, it's worth noting that Jack Hughes and Luke Hughes are still early in their careers and have yet to fully showcase their potential.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jack Hughes, the first overall pick in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft, has faced high expectations from the start. While he had a slower start to his rookie season, he has shown glimpses of his talent and possesses the tools to become a dominant center in the league. With time and experience, Jack has the potential to surpass his brothers and become the best player in the family.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Luke Hughes, the youngest of the three, is still developing his game but has already drawn attention from scouts and analysts. His combination of size, skill, and hockey IQ makes him a highly coveted prospect for the upcoming NHL Entry Draft. If he continues on his current trajectory, there's a strong possibility that Luke could surpass his brothers and establish himself as the best player in the family.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Determining the best player among the Hughes brothers is no easy task. Each brother brings a unique set of skills and potential to the table. Quinn Hughes has already established himself as a top defenseman in the NHL, while Jack Hughes and Luke Hughes are still early in their careers but possess immense talent and potential. Only time will tell who will ultimately stand out as the best player in the family, but one thing is for certain - the Hughes brothers have all made their mark in the sport of hockey and are destined for great success in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn6hlmah6tbTEZpmeq6Riva2t2J6pZqelqXqwsoyao6Vln5t6tbTEZp%2Bun5iawG6u0airoZ2iqA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-the-best-player-out-of-all-of-the-hughes-brothers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-the-best-player-out-of-all-of-the-hughes-brothers.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-the-best-player-out-of-all-of-the-hughes-brothers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-the-best-player-out-of-all-of-the-hughes-brothers.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-the-best-player-out-of-all-of-the-hughes-brothers.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-the-best-player-out-of-all-of-the-hughes-brothers.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./eric-hanhold.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./eric-hanhold.html>Eric Hanhold | Fan Arch</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-are-chandler-joness-parents-chandler-jones-biography-parents-name-and-more-453312-html.html>Who are Chandler Joness Parents?
