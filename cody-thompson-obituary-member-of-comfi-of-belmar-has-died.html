It is with a heavy heart that we share this news with you. Beyond his function as a wonderful employee, Cody was a beacon of warmth, friendliness, and guidance to everyone he came in contact with. His presence inside our team extended beyond the role of an exceptional employee.</p><p>Cody was knit into the fabric of our Comfi family as a wonderful individual—one who possessed an unrivalled and unwavering devotion to helping others, real concern, and generosity that was unmatched by anyone else. The combination of his genuine and approachable personality with his contagious attitude made each and every interaction with him a veritable treasure trove of laughter and delight.</p><p>It was clear that Cody’s heart and soul were filled with generosity in every aspect of his existence. He exemplified compassion in a way that was effortless, cheerfully providing assistance and support to everyone who was in need. It was a credit to his character that he was always willing to go the additional mile to ensure that others around him felt respected and supported. His altruistic nature was a testament to his character.</p><p>Cody’s lively personality, in addition to his kind attitude, brought a dash of humour and a dash of sass to the interaction that took place inside our team. The skill that he had was the capacity to make even the most ordinary situations funny, and it was this ability that brought light into our workplace.</p><p>Through the passing of Cody, our Comfi family has been left with an emptiness that cannot be filled. His laughter, leadership, and unflinching friendship are all things that we will miss dearly from his life. Both the legacy of compassion that he left behind and the beautiful memories that he bestowed upon us will be treasured for all of eternity.</p><p>We want Cody’s family, friends, and anybody else who had the honour of knowing him to know that our hearts and thoughts are with them during this trying time. May the innumerable moments of joy and warmth that he shared with them bring them comfort, and may they take comfort in the knowledge that his spirit will continue to live on in the lives that he touched.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwr86dsGasmKS6sb%2FOp2SompmpwqK%2B2GaknqWSmr9uu8Vmmqillp56sLKMm5ylpZGneqmt0mabop2UZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcody-thompson-obituary-member-of-comfi-of-belmar-has-died.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcody-thompson-obituary-member-of-comfi-of-belmar-has-died.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcody-thompson-obituary-member-of-comfi-of-belmar-has-died.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcody-thompson-obituary-member-of-comfi-of-belmar-has-died.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcody-thompson-obituary-member-of-comfi-of-belmar-has-died.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcody-thompson-obituary-member-of-comfi-of-belmar-has-died.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kubota-b2100.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kubota-b2100.html>Kubota B2100 Price, Specs, Review, Attachments 2022</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ross-harris-bio-age-wife-sons-finding-magic-mike.html>Who Is Finding Magic Mike's Ross Harris?
