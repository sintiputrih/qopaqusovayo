<time>16 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=492 data-injectable=true data-video=true>It’s no monumental secret that the genre of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">true crime</a></strong> has become extremely popular and sought-after as its rise to mainstream success has grown immensely over the last decade. From well-known cases surrounding big-name serial killers <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">such as Jeffrey Dahmer</a> and Ted Bundy, to mind-melting mysterious cases such as the ones we’ll be examining today, there’s undoubtedly an endless supply of content in the colossal true crime department, which keeps aficionados constantly on their toes.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=520 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>On that same note, it’s worth expressing that one of the most popular areas within the massive true crime bubble relates to cases that have remained unsolved for many years. Most of these cold cases pertain to perpetrators who committed their devious crime and disappeared while barely leaving a shred of evidence. As a result, true crime fanatics have been fascinated by a plethora of cases over the years — and part of being a true crime fan is diving in and attempting to solve a mysterious crime all on your own.</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=132 data-injectable=false>So, let’s carefully examine and showcase certain evidence as we highlight 10 chilling true crime cases that have yet to be solved.</p><h3 id=h-the-murder-of-the-boy-in-the-box data-injectable=false>The murder of the Boy in the Box</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boy-in-the-box.png><p data-characters=730 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>One of the most gut-wrenching cases in this entire list relates to the “Boy in the Box” — a young boy whose body was notably malnourished and found dead inside a box from JC Penney in the woods of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania back in 1957. It was eventually discovered that the boy was around four to six years old, and that he appeared to have died due to blunt force trauma to the head. The case soon became so widespread with media attention that the Boy in the Box was dubbed as “America’s Unknown Child.” In December 2022, the boy was finally identified as Joseph Augustus Zarelli, although the case still remains unsolved — despite several theories being discussed as to who was responsible for murdering Joseph.</p><h3 id=h-the-murders-of-russell-and-shirley-dermond data-injectable=false>The murders of Russell and Shirley Dermond</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/russell-shirley-dermond.png><p data-characters=728 data-current-count=1028 data-injectable=true>If there were ever a true crime case that horrified folks, then it would be the murders of Russell and Shirley Dermond. Back in May 2014, Russell Dermond was found decapitated in his house on Lake Oconee, in Georgia. However, it was soon discovered that his wife Shirley was missing, leading authorities to believe that someone had taken her. While Shirley’s body was discovered floating in Lake Oconee over a week later, shockingly, Russell’s severed head was never found. The brutality and “personal” agenda suggested by the murderer having removed and possibly kept Russell’s head has led true crime fanatics to believe that the couple was slain by someone close to the Dermonds, although the case remains unsolved.</p><h3 id=h-the-chicago-tylenol-murders data-injectable=false>The Chicago Tylenol murders&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tylenol-murders.png><p data-characters=730 data-current-count=1030 data-injectable=true>With the ubiquitous over-the-counter drug Tylenol’s popularity for quickly fixing a disastrous headache, it was no surprise that a series of murders linked to the medication terrorized many folks back in the ‘80s. After consuming Tylenol mysteriously laced with cyanide, seven people died, which eventually led to investigators from local police to the FBI looking into the bizarre case. As twisted as it all sounds, what’s even more terrifying is that the specific bottles of Tylenol came from a variety of different factories, leading authorities to believe the poisoning was done in-person, at stores. As it stands, no suspect has ever been charged for the case, and the case still remains unsolved over 30 years later.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-the-disappearance-of-brian-shaffer data-injectable=false>The disappearance of Brian Shaffer</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/brian-shaffer.png><p data-characters=681 data-current-count=981 data-injectable=true>As head-scratching and mysterious as a case can be, authorities, reporters, and true crime enthusiasts alike are still trying to wrap their heads around this case many years later. Back in March 2006, medical student Brian Shaffer disappeared while out with friends at a bar in Columbus, Ohio. Surveillance evidence suggested that Shaffer never left the bar that night, with many theorizing that he was either killed inside the bar and had his body hidden, left the bar in a disguise to start a new life, or that he had walked out the wrong entrance of the bar and fallen into a concrete construction site. Regardless of these theories, the case still remains unsolved to this day.</p><h3 id=h-the-disappearance-of-madeleine-mccann data-injectable=false>The disappearance of Madeleine McCann</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/madeleine-mccann.png><p data-characters=712 data-current-count=1012 data-injectable=true>Much like Brian Shaffer, it certainly didn’t take long for Madeleine McCann to become the center of a worldwide manhunt. The 3-year-old girl originally went missing back in May 2007 while vacationing with her parents and their friends in Portugal. While Madeleine and her parents’ friends’ kids were sleeping, the adults would dine in a nearby restaurant at the vacation resort, with one parent checking on the children regularly. However, when her mother Kate went to make a routine check, she realized Madeleine was gone. Over the years, many sighting reports have been documented and lengthy theories have been discussed, but one of the biggest true crime cases over the last 20 years is still unsolved.</p><h3 id=h-the-disappearance-of-johnny-gosch data-injectable=false>The disappearance of Johnny Gosch</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/johnny-gosch.png><p data-characters=700 data-current-count=1000 data-injectable=true>As one of many paperboys who mysteriously went missing back in the ‘80s, the disappearance of Johnny Gosch is a case that still perplexes folks to this very day. While on his paper route back in September 1982, Gosch was presumably kidnapped after several witnesses reported seeing him talking to an unknown man. The case took an unexpected turn back in 1997, when Johnny’s mother Noreen claimed that Johnny and an unknown man came to visit her. Noreen has claimed that was the last time she saw her son, although her accounting of events that night inspired her to write a book in 2000 about her son’s disappearance, including theories that he was kidnapped and trafficked by a pedophile ring.</p><h3 id=h-the-murder-of-the-black-dahlia data-injectable=false>The murder of the Black Dahlia</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/black-dahlia.png><p data-characters=640 data-current-count=940 data-injectable=true>There’s absolutely no denying that one of the most popular and most researched true crime cases of all time pertains to the jaw-dropping Black Dahlia case. Back in 1947, the body of Elizabeth Short (aka the Black Dahlia) was found in a vacant lot in Los Angeles. As one of the most gruesome crimes of all time, Short’s body was found mutilated — with her body severed into two pieces, her body drained all of its blood, and her face slashed from her mouth to her ears. Several theories have been documented over the years, along with a wide-range of potential suspects, but one of the biggest cases of all time still remains unsolved.</p><h3 id=h-the-killing-of-jonbenet-ramsey data-injectable=false>The killing of JonBenét Ramsey</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jonbenet-ramsey.png><p data-characters=921 data-current-count=1221 data-injectable=true>As far as true crime cases that achieve widespread attention are concerned, it’s worth noting that the murder of JonBenét Ramsey is one of the most well-known cases ever. Recognized by many as a prominent young beauty pageant contestant, Ramsey was killed at the age of just 6-years-old at her family home in Colorado back in 1996. Over the years, several theories have surrounded the high-profile case — with many insisting that either her older brother Burke murdered her in a fit of rage due to jealousy and envy, or that her father John killed her to keep her quiet about sexual abuse. Authorities have insisted that the household showed no signs of forced entry, along with a ransom note that was written belonging to her mother’s signature handwriting and being the same paper that was found in the Ramsey household. Despite a variety of head-scratching theories and evidence, the case has remained unsolved.</p><h3 id=h-the-mystery-of-mr-cruel data-injectable=false>The mystery of Mr. Cruel</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mr-cruel.png><p data-characters=576 data-current-count=876 data-injectable=true>One of the most spine-tingling true crime cases to ever come out of Australia belongs to the long-standing mystery of the Mr. Cruel case. Back in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, the area of Melbourne, Australia was haunted by Mr. Cruel — an intelligent, sinister child abductor who committed a series of attacks on several young children. Seeing as his identity was never revealed and he kidnapped children while wearing a balaclava, he was dubbed as “Mr. Cruel,” despite the lengths that he went to in a way that has been seen as “caring” to some true crime fans.</p><h3 id=h-the-mystery-of-the-zodiac-killer data-injectable=false>The mystery of the Zodiac Killer</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/zodiac-killer.png><p data-characters=599 data-current-count=899 data-injectable=false>You’d be hard pressed to find a true crime fanatic that isn’t completely knowledgeable about the mysterious case of the Zodiac Killer. As one of the most prolific serial killers of all time, the unidentified perpetrator has remained unknown since the ‘60s. Becoming a pop culture fixture, the Zodiac Killer was known for leaving an abundance of riddles, cyphers, and taunts in his letters which were mailed to numerous detectives and newspaper outlets. Plenty of theories pertaining to the killer’s identity have been discussed over the years, but the case still remains completely unsolved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3xyfIycn6KknJ67qHnTq6yeZZOntq6xjJyYrJ2jYsGprdNmqq2hnKF6s7HMmqCnZaWjwLC41Z6baA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-chilling-true-crime-cases-that-still-remain-unsolved.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-chilling-true-crime-cases-that-still-remain-unsolved.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-chilling-true-crime-cases-that-still-remain-unsolved.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-chilling-true-crime-cases-that-still-remain-unsolved.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-chilling-true-crime-cases-that-still-remain-unsolved.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-chilling-true-crime-cases-that-still-remain-unsolved.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bobby-lees-ex-girlfriend-khalyla-kuhn-relationship-with-brendan-schaub.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bobby-lees-ex-girlfriend-khalyla-kuhn-relationship-with-brendan-schaub.html>Bobby Lee's Ex-Girlfriend Khalyla Kuhn Changed His Relationship With Brendan Schaub Forever</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-cameron-mcadoo-girlfriend-age-instagram-facts-to-know-on.html>Who Is Cameron Mcadoo Girlfriend?
