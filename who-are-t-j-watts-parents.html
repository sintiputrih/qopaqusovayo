Watt initially pursued a career as a tight end when he joined the Wisconsin Badgers. His college journey faced a significant setback when he suffered a knee injury during the 2014 season, causing him to miss a substantial part of the 2015 season. In July 2015, head coach Paul Chryst made a pivotal decision, asking Watt to switch to a defensive position as a redshirt sophomore.</p><p>Despite the position change, <a href=# rel=noopener>Watt</a> quickly excelled in his new role as an outside linebacker. He led the Big Ten conference in sacks after the fourth game of his junior season.

He has continued to excel on the field, earning accolades such as AFC Defensive Player of the Week and being named to the Pro Bowl multiple times.</p><p>One of T.J.

He also set a franchise record for the Pittsburgh Steelers with 22.5 sacks in a single season. Despite facing injuries during his career, Watt has consistently been a dominant force on the field, earning the respect of his peers and fans alike.</p><p>In the 2022 season, Watt faced challenges with injuries, including a torn pectoral muscle, but still managed to make a significant impact when on the field. He made his return from injured reserve, contributing to the Steelers’ defensive efforts.</p><p>In the 2023 NFL season, T.J. Watt continued to shine as he achieved remarkable milestones. He recorded multiple sacks in games, surpassing James Harrison’s Steelers’ franchise sack record. Watt’s exceptional performance solidified his status as one of the league’s premier pass rushers.</p><p>T.J.
