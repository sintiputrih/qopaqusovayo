Lori went to the ‘Phoenix First Assembly of God’ and accepted Jesus Christ as her personal “Lord and Savior.” In the year 1991, she received her ministerial credentials. Later, she attended the Master’s Commission discipleship program and worked with the program for almost a decade.</p><p>In addition, she gained significant training and experience at various Phoenix First Assembly of God programs and volunteered at many ministry outreaches.

And, this was her first international trip.&nbsp;Likewise, in the year 1994, this personality established the organization Mourning to Joy Ministry.</p><p>Therefore, the organization is part of the church’s ministry that provides assistance and motivation to women dealing with post-abortion pain and trauma, and other critical issues. Moreover, the department has been featured in several noted journals, such as ‘Charisma,’ for its exceptional memorial services for unborn children and their mothers.</p><p>Further, for her dedicated service to the Lord through the church, she received an honorary invitation to speak and minister at the ‘Los Angeles International Church,’ also known as ‘The Dream Center.’ There, Lori met her future husband, Jim Bakker, who added immense positivity to her life.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-208790 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Lori-Bakker-Religion.jpeg alt="Lori Bakker" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-208790 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Lori Bakker and Jim’s picture. Source: Religion</p><h2><span id=Her_Works>Her Works</span></h2><p>Later, Lori founded ‘Lori’s House,’ an initiative that offers a safe, supportive home for pregnant women in difficult situations. Therefore, her own devastating experiences of repeated abortions and the mental trauma she had gone through during those days help her motivate women who are in similar situations. Lori serves as the president of the foundation.</p><p>As part of her services to the ministry of women, she shares her life story in churches across the country. Lori says that her troubled teenage years were a consequence of her father’s infidelity and her parent’s divorce. She has chronicled her adventurous life story in her book ‘More Than I Could Ever Ask.’</p><p>Moreover, the book was released by Thomas Nelson Publishers in the year 2000.

However, Lori first saw Jim in February of 1995, when he was preaching at her church in Phoenix.</p><p>Shortly after their first meeting, the two began dating. Like Lori, Jim, also, had a lot of emotional baggage from the past. Jim was earlier married to Tammy Faye Messner. They had two children: Tammy Sue “Sissy” Bakker Chapman and Jamie Charles “Jay” Bakker. However, Jim and Tamara divorced on March 13, 1992.</p><p>Moreover, Jim and Lori got married in front of 250 guests on September 4, 1998. Therefore, the wedding took place at the Burbank (California) home of their friends John and Joyce Caruso. Moreover, the ceremony was conducted by four pastors.</p><p>In the year 2002, they adopted five beautiful children, namely, Kelli, Nicks, Morgan, Nina, and Michelle Murillo, from the inner-city area of Phoenix.
