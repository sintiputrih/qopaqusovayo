Thankfully, things worked out in the end, and at first, that held true for the older cast. They secured a massive pay of $500,000 per episode.

"The "Modern Family" cast has resolved a major family feud. After a summer of heated salary negotiations that led to a lawsuit, the cancellation (and subsequent rescheduling) of a table read and a tense week of back-and-forth negotiations, the six adult actors on ABC's top-rated comedy have agreed in principle to new contracts with producer 20th Century Fox Television."</p><p>Had negotiations broken down, no doubt the comedy series would have been picked up by another network.</p><h2 id=ed-o-39-neill-joked-that-he-misses-the-money-the-most-from-his-time-on-modern-family>Ed O'Neill Joked That He Misses The Money The Most From His Time On Modern Family</h2><p>With a net worth of $65 million, Ed O'Neil is doing just fine these days, and he'll continue to cash in thanks to backend money. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">during the SAG Awards, the actor joked about not getting pay from Modern Family</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/modern-family-cast.jpg><p>The cast reunited on-stage, and it made for a tremendous moment.</p><p>O'Neill said at the award show, “I didn’t want to get emotional up here, but you know what I miss about it most of all? Money."</p><p>He still keeps in touch with the Modern Family cast these days. However, Sofia Vergara admitted O'Neal's texting game is very weak, as the actor tends to be late to the party during conversations.</p><p>"He doesn't really do it the right way," Vergara chuckled. "He'll answer us 26 weeks later, some joke or some question. We're all like, 'Huh?'"</p><p>Jokes aside, <a href=#>O'Neil turned out to be the exact opposite of what Sofia Vergara expected</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I used to watch Ed O’Neill when I was in Colombia so it was like I couldn’t believe it, and I was married to Ed O’Neill who was like 20 years older than me, I’m like, Oh my God!
