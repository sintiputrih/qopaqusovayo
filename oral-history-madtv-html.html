It debuted on October 14, 1995, airing on Fox at 11 p.m. on Saturday nights, directly across the dial, and country, from <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, which was at the time suffering one of its worst-ever slumps.

But during its 14-year tenure on the air it was a home to talent from celebrated sketch series like <i>The Ben Stiller Show</i>, <i>Kids in the Hall</i>, <i>SCTV</i>, and <i>In Living Color</i>, and it helped kickstart the careers of several big fish in today’s comedy pond — from Patton Oswalt to <i>Key & Peele</i>.

But let’s see how it goes.” I would put that audition at about 3 out of 10. Later Fax and Adam told me, “You were clearly the least seasoned in this world.

We would do short sketches and, like in <i>Mad Magazine</i>, movie parodies. We also had animation; that first season, we did <i>Spy vs. Spy</i> a couple times per episode. We definitely wanted it to be edgy.

Our show skewed a little more urban, in a way, so they definitely wanted to have that represented. Finding a Latino, male or female, was always something we were looking for. We always had diversity in the cast. That was very much a part of the creation.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d8aeadeb67ff8dcdd01f2aee921296f3-15-0-0@published data-word-count=117><b>Alex Borstein (cast member 1997–2002):</b> In L.A. and New York, our numbers always skyrocketed over <i>Saturday Night Live</i>. <i>SNL</i>’s pieces and sketches spoke to a very white, suburban world. Even though it was made in New York, its audiences tended to be kind of vanilla in the old days. <i>MADtv</i> really filled a different vacuum. Most of the fans were rainbow. Fans of <a href=#>Ms. Swan</a> in particular. She fit everything. People were like, “Oh my God, that’s my Greek grandmother.” “Oh my God, that’s my Mexican aunt.” “Oh my God, that’s my Chinese this …” “That’s my black this …” Everyone had that kind of experience. <i>MADtv</i> seemed to actually serve a real purpose in the community.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d8aeadeb67ff8dcdd01f2aee921296f3-17-0-0@published data-word-count=94><b>Sullivan</b>: I certainly played the majority of the racists on the show [<i>Laughs</i>]. We wanted to make people look stupid. That’s a big thing on <i>MADtv</i>. We were just setting my characters up to look like an idiot. And there were so many black members of our team, it was inevitable that that’s what a lot of stuff was gonna be. <i>SNL</i> would have that one black dude, and he would do something every three or four weeks where he’s, like, a thug, and that would be it. We were doing it every week.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d8aeadeb67ff8dcdd01f2aee921296f3-18-0-0@published data-word-count=51><b>Josh Meyers (cast member 2002–04): </b>The diversity of our cast allowed us to do some different stuff, certainly, but it also lent itself to the playing of stereotypes. Just playing the stereotypical African-American, the stereotypical Asian-American. <i>MADtv</i> could certainly do that, and did that. I don’t think always to great success.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d8aeadeb67ff8dcdd01f2aee921296f3-19-0-0@published data-word-count=152><b>Keegan-Michael Key (cast member, 2004–09):</b> The powers that be were not going for social commentary. What’s the outrageous joke? Let’s go for it, and let’s pull no punches. Of the people who say to me “I used to watch your show,” 65 to 70 percent of them would be Hispanic. Based on my own experience, I’d say the main demographic was people of color — Hispanics and blacks — who are middle class. And it’s more about class than race. Sometimes if people do manual labor or jobs of that variety, at the end of the day they’re like, “I’m tired. I want to go home. I want to laugh my ass off. If I’m going to watch comedy, what I really want is to identify with something immediately. It’s not about subtle or intellectual drama. I work too hard. I don’t want to think about it. I just want to laugh.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d8aeadeb67ff8dcdd01f2aee921296f3-20-0-0@published data-word-count=84>Then, also, there was a kind of outrageous broadness about the show that appealed to that demographic. People like to feel stimulated and titillated by seeing something they think they’re not supposed to see. People walked up to me and went, “Y’all is <i>wrong</i>.” The majority of the people in that demographic I’m speaking about are churchgoers, so there’s a moral center to what you’re supposed to do and not supposed to do. In a manner of speaking, you’re “not supposed to” watch <i>MADtv</i>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d8aeadeb67ff8dcdd01f2aee921296f3-21-0-0@published data-word-count=73><b>Borstein</b>: <i>MADtv</i> always wanted to be kind of an urban, hip, pop-culture machine. What made the show great was that they hired writers for whom that wasn’t their forte. They hired a lot of people that were extremely literate, extremely cerebral —&nbsp;people interested in trying to educate the public. It was this good clash, since the higher-ups were like, “Can you put Whitney Houston in it?” “Can we add Rosie O’Donnell to that?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d8aeadeb67ff8dcdd01f2aee921296f3-22-0-0@published data-word-count=83>There was that constant battle between going for something … not necessarily lowbrow, but more of a popular nature, and combining it with things that were weird. There’d be one sketch that was Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown high on coke, and then the next sketch would be this strange piece called “Sir,” where the only word Pat Kilbane and Will Sasso said to each other was “Sir.” It was brilliant, weird, postmodern. It felt very <i>Kids in the Hall </i>or <i>Mr. Show</i>-ish.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d8aeadeb67ff8dcdd01f2aee921296f3-23-0-0@published data-word-count=31><b>Michael McDonald (cast member, 1998–2009):</b> <i>MADtv</i> was a little bit more rebellious, a little rougher.

Lea Thompson and <a href=#><i>Caroline in the City</i></a> was another one. Holy crap, we couldn’t have rubbed that one harder onto the asphalt. I saw her at a charity event, and she and her daughter were not very pleased to see me. That sketch was probably the meanest one I’ve ever done. The only thing I didn’t approve of was the <a href=#>Chelsea Clinton</a> stuff. I thought that was mean, because she was just a little kid. But <i>MADtv</i> was not afraid to be mean.

They would write in or they would have their publicists go, “Hey, stop clowning so-and-so.” I heard through a mutual friend that a man who’s a wonderful comedian — who I really respect and love — didn’t quite care for my impersonation of him. On the other side of things, you do an impersonation of <a href=#>the Rock</a> and he’s not gonna fuckin’ give a shit —&nbsp;<a href=#>he did a piece on the show</a>. I thought that <a href=#>my impersonation of Fred Durst</a> was kind of shitty to Fred Durst, right? Come to meet him, and he’s a super sweetheart about it.

Brilliant, super-smart sketch. But what gets all the popularity on <i>MADtv</i>? <a href=#>Coach Hines.</a> I was a walking cartoon — a sight gag. I had super-high shorts up my ass, my fuckin’ whistle, and a stupid soup-strainer mustache, and that’s what they were tuning in for. I adored playing that character, even if none of the Coach Hines scenes are my favorite.

I don’t want to say, “calculated” in a bad way, but they weren’t trying to offend anyone. They wanted to be accepted. It was never “alternative.” Patton [Oswalt] and I were slinging shit into the wind sometimes.

That was during the period of all that vertical integration, where everyone wanted to own the material they were putting on the air, so we were always treated as this redheaded stepchild. They would promote the Fox-owned shows on Saturday night, and they would never promote what was gonna be on <i>MADtv</i>.

No sooner did we edit that pilot that Fox turned around and said “yes.” They knew they had a hit on their hands. When <i>MADtv</i> finally came along and hit the late-night market, they were extremely encouraged, and said, “Let’s put our money into it.” However, once we had a foothold in the market, they got very comfortable.

You’re at the writing table, and maybe it’s a really puerile sketch that has a lot of potty humor in it, but everyone’s laughing, so let’s do it. I would get frustrated because you’d have 15 people at the table — eight of them are writers, two are the showrunners, and the rest are execs — and all the writers and showrunners are crying they’re laughing so hard at a sketch.

They got Will Ferrell that year and raided the Groundlings, actually getting a couple people away from us that we were looking at casting. They resurged.

Okay, we’ll take those pictures.”) And then it’s like: Here’s the beat, here’s the character, let’s do this five times, and then that’s the end of the sketch.

It sounds like I’m blaming the audience —&nbsp;I’m not. But sometimes there would be a very good joke, and that joke would just get laughed over because they would laugh at a set-up a little too loud. <i>SNL</i>, being live, gives it that feel of excitement that <i>MADtv</i> could never really compete with.

If I was a young sketch performer coming up, I would think that watching <i>MADtv</i> would be just as valuable as watching <i>Mr. Show</i> and <i>SNL</i>, in terms of, like, “Sometimes this is what you have to do to overcome.” Maybe there’s a generation that will discover it — we just haven’t seen it happen.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d8aeadeb67ff8dcdd01f2aee921296f3-63-0-0@published data-word-count=125><b>McDonald</b>: You drive onto the lot of, let’s say, Warner Bros.
