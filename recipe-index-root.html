When I say the words ‚Äúpotato salad,‚Äù my mind can only think of the kind that is laden with mayonnaise‚Ä¶ which, admittedly, I will eat and enjoy once in a blue moon, but I love this one SO much more. By using par-boiled and then grilled potatoes, you get to taste the wonderful char-ry taste of the actual potato and not just a bunch of mayo.

For the 3 recipes I‚Äôm sharing this week (the first was a grilled asparagus&nbsp;recipe if you missed it), I really wanted to choose produce that‚Äôs less commonly grilled. We‚Äôll have all summer to grill my favorite staples like peppers, zucchini, and eggplant. I‚Äôve never grilled avocado, so I thought ‚Äúooh, that‚Äôll be fun!‚Äù It was fun, we loved it, and so will you: How to Make This Grilled Avocado Recipe Start by making the veggie ceviche filling with hearts of palm (they have a fish-like texture), tomato, serrano pepper, cilantro, and diced red onion for crunch.

This week, each of the 3 recipes I‚Äôm going to post will all involve the grill. The sun is finally shining and we‚Äôre getting ready for Memorial Day weekend, so what better time to cook outside? Of course if you don‚Äôt have an outdoor grill, you can always use a cast iron grill pan on the stove top. We‚Äôre starting this series with one of my favorite things to grill ‚Äì asparagus! The key to great grilled asparagus is finding really fresh thin spears of asparagus. I like fat spears for ribboning, but thin spears are‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you love asparagus, but the people you‚Äôre living with don‚Äôt, this post is for you. Even if you‚Äôre just&nbsp;blas√© about asparagus, like I used to be, give it a chance by ribboning it! The thin, raw ribbons tossed with olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper are so fresh and delicious that you‚Äôll completely avoid the unpleasant fibrous, stringy experience that asparagus sometimes causes. You can toss them in salads, put them on pizza‚Ä¶ last weekend we ate them on fancy toast because these happened to be the ingredients that I had on hand.

However, it doesn‚Äôt include the traditional tuna or hard-boiled eggs. It may be completely unconventional, but it‚Äôs completely delicious (and completely vegan, too!). Chickpea Salad Sandwich Recipe Components This chickpea salad sandwich starts with my favorite plant-based ‚Äútuna‚Äù salad. It‚Äôs briny and tangy from capers, Dijon mustard, and lemon juice. Instead of mayo, I add a bit of tahini to make it rich and creamy.

It‚Äôs easy to make, it serves a crowd, and it‚Äôs packed with fresh veggies. I love making it when we host friends and family for brunch in the spring. My Mom‚Äôs Healthy Breakfast Casserole Speaking of Mother‚Äôs Day, my mom actually gave me the inspiration for this vegetarian breakfast casserole recipe! She‚Äôs been making breakfast casseroles for years, but she started using sweet potatoes in hers just recently.

I know you will absolutely love this book ‚Äì there are SO many amazing allergen-free baking recipes (many are vegan as well). In addition to this simple strawberry tart, there are cakes, cookies, bars, pies, muffins, quick breads, and pop tarts. Each recipe is more decadent than the one before it, yet they all have short ingredient lists and simple instructions. I can‚Äôt wait to try the Apple Pie Bars and Double Chocolate Muffins in the fall, but right now, I‚Äôm obsessed with this‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy Wednesday! Currently, we‚Äôre en route from Japan where we ate a lot of soba noodles. Of course, we didn‚Äôt eat them quite like this ‚Äì in Japan, soba would never be tossed with vegetables and doused with a bright, creamy, sesame-orange-cashew sauce‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôre not in Japan any more, so here goes! üôÇ For this recipe, I use the whole head of broccoli, stalk and all. I don‚Äôt know why we ever started tossing the stalk ‚Äì it‚Äôs every bit as edible as the florets (find other ideas to use the whole head here and here).

I have to say, it‚Äôs kind of nice to start the day super early. Who knew one could accomplish so much in a day when you wake up at 5am?! While I‚Äôm not giving up actual rice anytime soon, and certainly not while we‚Äôre in Japan, I love my cauliflower rice, and I especially love this turmeric-spiced cauliflower fried rice with creamy cardamom yogurt sauce. It checks all of those necessary weeknight-friendly recipe boxes:‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>As I‚Äôve gotten older, a funny thing has happened where I‚Äôve become less obsessed with chocolate desserts and more in love with fruity desserts ‚Äì especially if those fruits happen to be strawberries! I can enjoy chocolate cake in moderation, but when it comes to strawberries, I want them all. To me, strawberry shortcake is the perfect not-too-sweet, fresh & fruity summer treat. So naturally, when I flipped through my friend Gaby‚Äôs gorgeous new cookbook What‚Äôs Gaby Cooking: Everyday California Food, I went straight for the strawberry shortcake recipe. Well, actually, there were two strawberry recipes that spoke to me.‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Today is the last day of my 5-part meal plan, and it‚Äôs a good one! I love this curried cauliflower soup! It‚Äôs so darn simple to make and it‚Äôs so delicious with the curry spices. There‚Äôs a little kick from the cayenne and some brightness from the lemon. The ingredient list is short, so this is definitely a recipe that‚Äôs bound for the regular meal rotation‚Ä¶ and it came about so unexpectedly. See, I started the this meal plan series last week with a set amount of groceries and ideas for 5 meals, each meal using the ingredients from the‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfmK61scaoqbJnopqwqrzEZqCnnJWterO7zq1mrJ2RqLyve8%2Banp5nZ2l8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frecipe-index-root.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frecipe-index-root.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frecipe-index-root.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frecipe-index-root.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frecipe-index-root.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frecipe-index-root.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./patrick-swayze.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./patrick-swayze.html>Patrick Swayze Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./eugene-byrd.html>Eugene Byrd Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./eugene-byrd.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
