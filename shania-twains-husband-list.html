People born in the year of the snake are idealists. They may appear frigid on the outside, but on the inside, they are warm and eager. Their yearning for sole possession is intense. It irritates them when they don't fully comprehend someone. Snakes are dedicated and determined, but their greatest adversary is lethargy.</p><p>People born on August 28 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Virgo</strong>. "If you want something done, give it to a busy person," as the saying goes. That is, without a doubt, the Virgo anthem. Virgos approach life logically, practically, and methodically. Virgo is an earth sign that has historically been associated with the goddess of wheat and agriculture, a relationship that alludes to Virgo's profound roots in the tangible world. This earth sign is a perfectionist at heart who isn't scared to develop his or her talents through thorough and regular practice.</p><p>Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter whose 1997 album, Come On Over, became the best-selling studio album of all time by a female artist.
