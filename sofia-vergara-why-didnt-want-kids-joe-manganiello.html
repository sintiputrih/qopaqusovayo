Not only because she shouldn't have to have a child if she doesn't want to, but because she doesn't think she could be the kind of mother she would want to be at this point in her life.</p><p>"There’s things in life that might sound like good ideas, but they’re not," she said. "I was a mother already. <strong>I know what it means to be a good mother or to try to be the best mother that you can, and that takes a lot of sacrifices, takes a lot of energy</strong>."</p><p>She also spoke about how she thinks that, despite it being possible with scientific advances, there's a reason women naturally stop being able to conceive when they're approaching 50.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Nowadays, thanks to science, women can actually have babies older," she went on. Cameron Diaz recently had a child at 51, for instance. "Before, nature for some reason tells your body at 50 you are in menopause, it’s time for you to be done with that. There is a reason why nature is doing that."</p><p>Sofia Vergara clarified that she has nothing against women who chose to this path. "That’s for me, and I totally respect where anyone wants to be a mom after 50." For her, it was more about her priorities at this age. "<strong>I didn’t think because of my career, the way I live my life, the way my marriage was, that it was fair to bring a kid to this world, and I’m not going to be able to give 100 percent</strong>."</p><h2 id=sofia-vergara-finds-it-difficult-to-date-after-the-divorce>Sofia Vergara Finds It Difficult To Date After The Divorce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sofia-vergara-outside-agt.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Sofia Vergara is now dating again, she admitted that she's had a hard time dating after the divorce.

"<strong>Everything sometimes gets not interpreted the right way. So life is already hard. Having relationships is hard. Problems are hard</strong>. And then to see it out there and be completely changed, you want to be like, 'What is going on?' But you just get used to it. It comes with being famous, so you can’t complain that much."</p><p>Despite all this, it seems she's found love again. <strong>She recently announced on her Instagram that <a href=#>she's dating Justin Saliman</a>, a doctor who, incidentally, tended to her after she had knee surgery</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqqJ6Zlnq3sdGgmKuZXay1unnDopunrF2srq%2FAjKSgnatdn7ymecyapaCZnp6yrbjOaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsofia-vergara-why-didnt-want-kids-joe-manganiello.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsofia-vergara-why-didnt-want-kids-joe-manganiello.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsofia-vergara-why-didnt-want-kids-joe-manganiello.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsofia-vergara-why-didnt-want-kids-joe-manganiello.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsofia-vergara-why-didnt-want-kids-joe-manganiello.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsofia-vergara-why-didnt-want-kids-joe-manganiello.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./johnny-joey-jones-wiki-bio-family-marine-zodiac-height-fox-news.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./johnny-joey-jones-wiki-bio-family-marine-zodiac-height-fox-news.html>Who Is Johnny Joey Jones?
