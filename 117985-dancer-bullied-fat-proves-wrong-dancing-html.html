That's why he has found a special connection to the SWAGGA rhythm, a new one that "fat activists" have created so that many more people feel freer to join.</p><p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>FACING CONSEQUENCES</strong></h3></p><p class=Fg>Bullying and body shaming are serious things and <a class="Xd a" href=#>kids who harass other peers</a> should be told that their actions have consequences. Like this father had to do when he learned that his eldest daughter, Callie, was involved in harassing an overweight girl in her school.</p><p class=Fg>One day he received a call from a crying woman who claimed that her daughter was harassed by Callie and her friends. They took photos of the girl in ‘funny’ poses, such as bending over when she was picking something up.</p><p class=Fg>The girl was over-weight and the photographs had to do with fat shaming. The girl felt humiliated and tried to slit her wrists and was taken to the hospital. The father was upset.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpocHFoanqlrc2cnKtlkqq5rbXEnWSfmaRivbO71Z6qZq%2BipLuoecOapZyhnpx7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f117985-dancer-bullied-fat-proves-wrong-dancing-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f117985-dancer-bullied-fat-proves-wrong-dancing-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f117985-dancer-bullied-fat-proves-wrong-dancing-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f117985-dancer-bullied-fat-proves-wrong-dancing-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f117985-dancer-bullied-fat-proves-wrong-dancing-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f117985-dancer-bullied-fat-proves-wrong-dancing-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./joanna-garcia-swisher-bio-wiki-age-height-reba-movies-and-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./joanna-garcia-swisher-bio-wiki-age-height-reba-movies-and-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html>JoAnna Garca Swisher BioWiki, Age, Height, Reba, Movies and Tv Shows and Net Worth.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cooper-manning-wiki.html>Cooper Manning Wiki, Biography, Parents, Age, Ethnicity, Wife, Children, Career, Net Worth &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cooper-manning-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
