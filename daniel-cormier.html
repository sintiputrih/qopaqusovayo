During his time in high school, he managed to win 3 Louisiana State Championship titles in wrestling.</span></p><p><span>He had an outstanding record in high school, winning more than 100 fights and losing only 9.</span></p><p><span>Well, this might come as a surprise for a lot of fans, but little did you know that the former Olympian was also an all-state football player.</span></p><p><span>He played in the line-breaker position. Also, he declined the offer to play football to pursue his passion for wrestling.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, Cormier won the junior college national championship twice during his time at Colby Community College.</span></p><p><span>He then moved to Oklahoma State University, where he was an NCAA Division I freestyle wrestler. It was the year 2000 when he first entered the national tournament as a third seed at 184 pounds.</span></p><p><span>However, he just missed the mark by one match of turning into an All-American.</span></p><p><span>In 2001, the wrestler at 184 pounds weight class reached the finals and eventually turned into an all-American, though he lost the finals by 8-4 to <a href=#>Cael Sanderson</a>.</span></p><p><span>With 27 falls, his last record was 53-10, where 6 of his misfortunes were against <a href=#>Cael Sanderson</a>.</span></p><p><span>The veteran’s phenomenal performance continued at the highest level. He won the senior US national championship consecutively from 2003 until 2008.</span></p><p><span>That led him to represent the USA at the world level for every one of those years.&nbsp;</span></p><h4>Olympics</h4><p><span>Furthermore, at the </span><span>2004 Olympics</span><span>, he represented Team USA. Despite good performances throughout the Olympics, his gold medal hunt concluded in the semifinals as he faced defeat against </span><span>Khadzhimurat Gatsalov</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>He was also named captain of the USA wrestling team in the 2008</span><span> Olympics</span><span>&nbsp;but was later pulled out of the competition due to kidney failure.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-24-at-9.07.29-AM-1024x758.png><p><span>Meanwhile, Cormier won a bronze medal in the 2007</span> <span>Wrestling World Championships</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>He continued on the same path to winning a gold medal at the</span> <span>Golden Grand-Prix Ivan Yarygin </span><span>held in Krasnoyarsk, Russia.</span></p><p><span>The same wrestling tournament is considered one of the most extremely challenging matches in the world.</span></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Sapp – Football, Movies, Wrestling, Facts & MMA>>></a></strong></p><h4>Mixed Martial Arts and UFC Career</h4><p><span>After his exclusion from the 2008 Olympics, the former olympian started to train alongside </span><span>Cain Velasquez</span><span>, </span><span>J</span><span>on Fitch</span><span>, </span><span>and</span> <span>Josh Koscheck</span> <span>at</span> <span>American Kickboxing Academ</span><span>y </span><span>to pursue a career in mixed martial arts.</span></p><p><span>In the wake of his professional appearance, Cormier made a trip to Australia and battled for Xtreme MMA; he crushed Lucas Browne to win the Xtreme MMA Heavyweight Championship on July 31, 2010.</span></p><p><span>A couple of weeks later, Cormier won his second MMA title by winning the KOTC Heavyweight Championship from Tony Johnson.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, he was also featured in Strikeforce Challengers. He had an eight-fight agreement with Strikeforce Organization.</span></p><p><span>You must have heard some big-time friendship fairy tale stories. But when it comes to Cormier, he did something impressive by moving down to UFC’s light heavyweight division, just because of his teammate, Cain Velasquez, as UFC heavyweight champion.</span></p><p><span>Before moving down to UFC’s light heavyweight division, he had won two out of two fights.</span></p><p><span>In 2015, then-light heavyweight champion Jon Jones was deprived of the light heavyweight title and suspended uncertainly in the wake of dealing with lawful offense indictments.</span></p><p><span>This created Daniel’s chance to replace Jon Jones to fight against Anthony Johnson at UFC 187 for the void title on May 23, 2015.</span></p><p><span>In the initial seconds of the battle, Cormier was dropped by an overhand right by Johnson.</span></p><p><span>Subsequently, in the next two rounds, the former MMA fighter triumphed.</span></p><p><span>The win in the last two rounds was enough for Cormier to become the new </span><span>UFC light heavyweight champion</span><span>. This also earned him, a Performance of the Night bonus.</span></p><h4>Heavyweight&nbsp; Champion</h4><p><span>Additionally, in 2015, it was announced that the light heavyweight champion had signed a new eight-fight deal with UFC.</span></p><p><span>However, a rematch with the former light heavyweight champion, Jon Jones, was to take place in April of 2016 but had to be called off due to Cormier’s foot injury.</span></p><p><span>Later, the fight was rescheduled for July 9, 2016, which was also canceled due to possible doping violations by Jon Jones.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-24-at-9.22.24-AM-1024x555.png><p><span>Though a rematch with Anthony Johnson took place on April 8, 2017, at UFC 210, Cormier could retain his title with a win.</span></p><p><span>The long-awaited rematch with Jon Jones finally occurred on July 29, 2017, at UFC 214. Jones defeated Cormier to reclaim the title.</span></p><p><span>Afterward, it was found that Jon had violated doping law and tested positive for </span><span>anabolic steroids</span><span>. Thus, the title was returned to Cormier.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>On July 7, 2018, the long human-made history became the 2nd fighter to hold two titles concurrently in the UFC.</span></p><p><span>In the process of doing so, he defeated <a href=#>Stipe Miocic</a> for</span><span> UFC heavyweight championship</span><span>. Following his title win, he later made his first heavyweight title defense and crushed Derrick Lewis to defend the heavyweight championship successfully.</span></p><p><span>This fight made him the first UFC fighter to win and defend both the light heavyweight and heavyweight titles and the first UFC fighter to defend both championships.</span></p><p><span>Later, on August 17, 2019, the heavyweight champion lost in a rematch with <a href=#>Stipe Miocic</a> and ended his heavyweight championship reign.</span></p><p><span>Thus, a year later, on August 15, 2020, the UFC light heavyweight and heavyweight champion decided to hang up his gloves.</span></p><p><strong>Do check out some of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 38 Roy Jones Jr. Quotes>></a></strong></p><h3><span>Awards and Achievements</span></h3><ul><li><span>UFC Heavyweight Champion in 2018</span></li><li><span>UFC Light Heavyweight Champion in 2015</span></li><li><span>Xtreme MMA Heavyweight Champion</span></li><li><span>First UFC fighter&nbsp; to successfully defend both UFC light heavyweight and heavyweight titles</span></li><li><span>Bronze Medalist in the 2007 World Wrestling Championship</span></li><li><span>Gold Medalist at Pan American Games(2002)</span></li><li><span>Bronze Medalist at the 2007 Pan American Games</span></li><li><span>Silver Medalist at </span><span>Wrestling World Cup</span><span> in 2005</span></li><li><span>Two times Gold Medalist at Dave Schultz Memorial International Open(2001, 2007)</span></li><li><span>Bronze Medalist at Dave Schultz Memorial International Open in 2002</span></li><li><span>Six times USA Senior National Champion(20003-2008)</span></li><li><span>John Smith Freestyle Wrestler of the Year award in 2007</span></li><li><span>Most Outstanding Fighter of the Year in 2018</span></li><li><span>Analyst of the Year award in 2018</span><span>(</span><span>World MMA Awards</span><span>)</span></li><li><span>Best MMA Fighter in 2018 (</span><span>ESPY Award</span><span>)</span></li><li><span>ESPN Fighter of the Year(2018)</span></li><li><span>Strikeforce</span> <span>Heavyweight Grand Prix Champion</span></li><li><span>King of the Cage </span><span>Heavyweight Champion</span></li></ul><h3><span>Daniel Cormier | Injury</span></h3><p>As a professional fighter, not every day is a ray of sunshine; thus, you have to face rain in the middle.</p><p>Therefore, as you fight, you are bound to get hurt but at an uncertain timeframe.
