Jesús Gallardo is one of the important players for both the Mexican national team and Monterrey.</span></h3><h2><span id=Early_Life><b>Early Life</b></span></h2><p><span>Jesús Gallardo was born in Tabasco, Mexico, on <strong>August 15, 1994.</strong> Likewise, he is <strong>27 years old.</strong> He was born to Jose Albert Gallardo Sedano, his father, and his mother Maribel Vasconcelos Games, who both worked in Tabasco. Gallardo is said to have a younger sister. However, there is no evidence of this. In any interview or social media post, Jesus has never acknowledged his siblings. Jesus remained in his birthplace until he was in his adolescence. He liked to play football with his mates when he was younger. Gallardo was never satisfied with just playing with his friends. He desired to be exposed to others.</span></p><p><span>There is no information available about his education. Gallardo’s status as a high school graduate is still unknown. Furthermore, according to certain accounts, Jesus finished his primary schooling in his hometown. After that, at the age of 15, he transferred to another school, where he began to play amateur football. He enrolled in a football training school in Tabasco. Jesus abandoned his formal education in favor of pursuing his passion for football.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-198939 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jesus-with-his-family.jpg alt="jesus with his family" width=650 height=374 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-198939 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Jesús Gallardo with his mom and dad Source: Players Bio</p><h2><span id=Jesus_Gallardo_8211_Net_Worth_2023>Jesús Gallardo – Net Worth 2023</span></h2><p><span>Jesús Gallardo mostly earned his fortunes playing for the national team and Liga MX. He also has various endorsements and acts for different brand advertisements. He earns around $22000 weekly. Jesús earns annually about $1.16 million. He is a top 10 earner in Liga MX. He has a total <strong>net worth</strong> of 6.5 million dollars.</span></p><h2><span id=Professional_Career><b>Professional Career</b></span></h2><p><span>Jesús Gallardo began playing amateur football when he was 15 years old. After attracting the notice of a local football coach, he joined the football training. In 2009, he was recruited to play football by Once Hermanos, a local football club. People, on the other hand, doubted Jesus’ skill because he was still a young player. Gallardo, on the other hand, managed to score goals, surprising the fans. After a successful season with his hometown club, Once Hermanos, Jesus decided to join Jaguares de la 48, a division one club. In 2011, he signed a deal with the Club.</span></p><p><span>Gallardo astounded everyone, including other Liga MX club coaches. In 2013, he was asked to train in the Youth Academy of Club Universidad Nacion or Pumas. Jesus decided to quit the club and train at the Pumas’ camp. Gallardo dedicated himself to training for a year in order to develop his skills.</span></p><h4><b>Club Career</b></h4><p><span>In 2014, he was backed by Club Universidad Nacion [UNAM] to play for their under-twenty team. Morelos was promoted to the main squad when his coach noticed his tackling, dribbling, and speed abilities. Gallardo made his UNAM professional debut in November 2014, competing in the Copa MX competition. When he first played for the league, he was 19 years old.</span></p><p><span>Daniel Gallardo grabbed the audience’s hearts in the 2017 encounter against Monterrey, where he scored the game-tying goal. Because the Monterey club was slightly ahead of UNAM in the standings, this match was extremely important for UNAM fans.</span></p><h4><b>Monterrey Club has signed a contract with him</b></h4><p><span>In 82 games for UNAM, </span><span>Jesús </span><span>scored 11 goals. Because <span>Jesús </span>played left-back for the squad, his scores are not low. He has a greater number of assists, which has aided the Club in winning important league titles. Gallardo chose to play for another Liga MX team, Monterrey, in 2018. On July 21, 2018, he made his Monterrey debut, winning against Club de Futbol Pachuca. On October 20, 2018, Jesus scored his first goal for Monterrey against Tijuana Football Club. Gallardo also scored a penalty goal against Pachuca, advancing Monterrey to the finals of the Apertura Copa MX 2018. He had nine goals in nine appearances for Monterrey Football Club since 2018. Gallardo has renewed his contract, thus he has no plans to quit the Club.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-198910 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jesus-mexico.jpg alt="jesus mexico" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-198910 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Jesús Gallardo dribbling the football Source: Stumptown Footy</p><h4><b>International Career</b></h4><p><span>Gallardo was chosen by Mexico’s national squad to play after a stellar performance in Liga MX.&nbsp; Jesus made his debut for his country in 2016. In that encounter, he helped on a game-winning pass as Mexico defeated New Zealand. Mexico went on to overcome New Zealand, and his coach commended him for his efforts. Mexico’s national team opted to choose him for the 2018 World Cup in Russia after he returned to impressive performances.</span></p><p><span>However, during the World Cup group stage match versus Sweden, a horrible occurrence occurred. Gallardo received a yellow card in 13 seconds during the match, the fastest yellow card in FIFA WORLD CUP history. Since 2016, Jesus has represented his country in a total of 47 matches. He has not scored a goal yet. However, Gallardo has assisted important passes that have resulted in goals. He has won several awards and trophies playing football for the national team and club.</span></p><h2><span id=Controversy><b>Controversy</b></span></h2><p><span>When people get famous, their actions and words are constantly being watched. Jesús has found himself in controversies several times.</span></p><h4>Anti-Gay Slur</h4><p><span><span>Jesús</span> Gallardo played a role in Monterrey’s defeat to Club America in January 2020. They celebrated Monterrey’s 2019 Apertura in Estadio Azteca when they won the title.</span></p><p><span>Gallardo danced around the pitch during the last whistle at that point. It wasn’t the only thing, though. He was apparently caught on tape signing an anti-Club America chant with antigay overtones.</span></p><p><span>As a result, Liga MX launched an investigation into the matter, and Gallardo was suspended for the first two games of the 2020 Clausura. He was also charged with a fine of a specific amount.</span></p><p><span>Gallardo took to Twitter to say “Ni Modo” when they announced his sentence for the “inappropriate celebration.” The phrase simply means “anything” when translated. The tweet, however, was eventually removed.</span></p><h4>Fake Corona Cough</h4><p><span>In March of the same year, Jesus Gallardo stirred some controversy when he insulted the novel coronavirus. He then faked a cough and said, “Greetings to Coronavirus.”</span></p><p><span>Reporters and cameramen were covering Scratched Course’s departure for Guadalajara for the match versus Chivas. As a result, when Jesus approached the New Lion Airport, Gallant, pretended to cough in front of them.</span></p><h4>Live Broadcast Controversy</h4><p><span><span>Jesús</span> Gallardo was recently spotted in a live broadcast at the beginning of April. He was, in reality, describing the global spread of coronavirus and its consequences.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, he used the opportunity to ridicule and remember the title from Estadio Azteca.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;The Disciplinary Commission suspended him for two games.</span></p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p><span><span>He is in a relationship with <strong>Orquídea</strong>. There isn’t much information or a timeline about how the couple met. Orquídea has an Instagram account&nbsp; @</span></span>orquidea.gc which has 19.3k followers. Not much is known about her. The couple recently became parents. They welcomed their son in 2021.</p><p><span>In an interview with ESPN, Gallardosaidd that he wants to spend time with his mother and father. He values his family. Jesus adores his father and mother and does everything he can to make them happy.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-198917 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jesus-and-his-gf.jpg alt="jesus and his gf" width=650 height=647 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-198917 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Jesús Gallardo and his girlfriend Orquídea posing for a camera in a stadium Source: Instagram</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements>Body Measurements</span></h2><p><span>Jesús Gallardo has</span>&nbsp;a height of<strong> 5 feet and 10 inches</strong>. <span>Jesús weigh around 68kg.
