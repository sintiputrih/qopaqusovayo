She has also proven to be a real force to be reckoned with when it comes to keeping things real, and approaching some of <a href=#>life's most difficult moments </a>with tenacity and resilience. When she put her focus into a huge project and released Rumors with <strong><a href=#>Cardi B</a></strong>, she knew she was going to see some incredible results that would lead to increased fame and fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, what she may not have realized was the fact that the more she 'put herself out there,' and the more success she experienced, the louder the trolls were going to become. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News </a>reports that she has seen a mix of highs and lows since <a href=#>releasing Rumors</a>, and we're about to discover them all...</p><h2 id=her-fame-skyrocketed><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Her Fame Skyrocketed</span></h2><p>The very first thing that Lizzo noticed after releasing Rumors, was the fact that her fame absolutely skyrocketed. Already doing well on her own accord, Lizzo had millions of followers on all her social media platforms but working with Cardi B on such a risqué release definitely catapulted her to the next level. Lizzo's name was in every headline, and the world was tuning in to her music and realizing her talents in a whole new way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Cardi B Defends Lizzo Against Cruel, Body Shaming Trolls</a></span></p><h2 id=she-topped-the-charts><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Topped The Charts</span></h2><p>It didn't take long for Rumors to reach the highest levels of success. The accolades started rolling in and records were being smashed over and over again, as the single began to pick up traction by a multitude of streaming platforms across the globe. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Headline Planet</a> reported that; "In addition to topping the US iTunes song sales chart, Lizzo & Cardi B’s “Rumors” received massive opening day airplay at three major radio formats, attracted ample interest on YouTube, and made the Top 5 on the US Spotify and Apple Music Charts." The song later reached the #1 spot on the YouTube Trending For Music Chart, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-fortune-increased-dramatically><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Her Fortune Increased Dramatically</span></h2><p>Make no mistake, Lizzo's bank account has seen quite a few more zeros since the release of Rumors. She danced all the way to the bank as the money started pouring in, as a result of this mega-hit single. Lizzo has been steadily increasing her net worth over the past several years, but the release of this particular collaboration was so hot that her finances dramatically increased. The money was rolling in fast and furious, and it was instantly apparent that this was the big hit that would define her for the next several months, if not more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-haters-started-hating><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Haters Started Hating</span></h2><p>Sadly, all of this success also led to a whole lot of haters rising to the surface. The greater her accomplishments, the more it seems that Lizzo's haters start dragging her name. Instead of being able to relish in the sweet moments of her success, Lizzo was being dragged by trolls who took aim at her body type, size, and even her race by way of hurtful social media commentary. Trolls wasted no time sharing hateful, hurtful comments that really packed a painful sting.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Offset Defends Lizzo Against Internet Trolls</a></span></p><h2 id=she-was-deeply-affected-by-trolls><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Was Deeply Affected By Trolls</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lizzo took to social media to post a video of <a href=#>her deep sadness</a> over the terrible, derogatory comments that people were making towards her. She broke down in an honest display of pain and frustration, telling fans that when she is so exhausted from throwing herself into her work, she tends to be more 'sensitive' and isn't able to block out the haters and rude comments the way she normally can. She was visibly affected by the terrible words her haters aimed at her and spent much of the video in tears.</p><h2 id=cardi-b-rose-to-her-rescue><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Cardi B Rose To Her Rescue</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cardi B wasn't going to stand idle as her friend was being tormented. She rose to the occasion and stepped up to publicly defend Lizzo and put her trolls right back in their place. She posted an image depicting the incredible success that Rumors has seen, and blasted fans for hating on someone instead of being happy for them and encouraging of their success. Cardi then proceeded to share snippets of various movie charts, stating to fans that Lizzo was a huge success, and they were just jealous of her incredible accomplishments.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>YouTuber Nicole Arbour Criticized After She Blasts Lizzo For Crying On Instagram</a></span></p><h2 id=facebook-backed-her-up-in-a-big-way><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Facebook Backed Her Up In A Big Way</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an unprecedented, never-before seen move, Facebook executives stepped up to the plate to force a change in the way hateful comments were handled on their platforms. Both Facebook and Instagram are now going to be defunking the accounts of those who interefere with others by leaving hateful commentary online. They've made it clear that there's no further allowance of hateful language or conversation, and have even gone so far as to say that they will be deleting the accounts of repeat offenders.</p><h2 id=she-announced-her-comeback-to-music><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>She Announced Her Comeback To Music</span></h2><p>In spite of all the ups and downs and standing ferociously in the face of anyone who dares to try and shake her up, Lizzo has announced that drop of Rumors is the signal of her return to music. After a long hiatus, she has decided that she's throwing herself right back in to the music industry, and will be sharing an abundance of new tunes and videos with her fans in the near future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Fans Argue As Facebook Removes Onslaught Of Hateful Comments About Lizzo</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtqmagkaW9prrEnWStp12htrvGzmaqoqaTmnq1tMRmqZ6klZbApnnOn2ShnaJiv7a5zquqZqWlqLakedWim56nXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-whats-happened-to-lizzo-since-the-release-of-her-rumors-music-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheres-whats-happened-to-lizzo-since-the-release-of-her-rumors-music-video.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheres-whats-happened-to-lizzo-since-the-release-of-her-rumors-music-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheres-whats-happened-to-lizzo-since-the-release-of-her-rumors-music-video.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-whats-happened-to-lizzo-since-the-release-of-her-rumors-music-video.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-whats-happened-to-lizzo-since-the-release-of-her-rumors-music-video.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jenni-farley-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jenni-farley-net-worth-2024.html>Jenni Farley Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./eric-heiden-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Eric Heiden Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./eric-heiden-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
