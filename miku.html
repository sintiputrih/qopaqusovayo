He started his professional career soon after, in 2004.</p><p>He was loaned by the LaLiga giants to teams that played in the second and third tiers of the Spanish football system for a period of five consecutive seasons.</p><p>Due to the surplus of strikers at Valencia at the point of time, he was sold to Getafe CF in 2010 signing a four and a half year contract with the club.</p><p>Moreover, he made his debut for the Venezuelan National team on the 16th of August, 2006, at the age of 21.

In the 2018–19 season, he and his team won the competition after a 1–0 extra-time defeat of Goa in the final.</p><p>He had a fairly successful spell at Getafe, as he scored on many important occasions to lead his team to victory. This included a brace in Getafe’s 3-0 victory over his past club, Valencia.</p><h4><span>Further…</span></h4><p>After short spells at Gharafa and Rayo Vallecano, he transferred to the newly formed ISL team, Bengaluru FC on a two-year contract.</p><p>He was the second top-scorer in the tournament, leading Bengaluru to the final in their first year in the ISL.</p><p>Venezuela performed disappointingly in the next edition of the Copa America, as they only finished third in their group.</p><p>Then, they failed to qualify for the knockout stages of the tournament.</p><p>The president of the Venezuelan Football Federation accused 15 players, including him to be involved in a conspiracy to sack their manager.</p><p>In addition, all players accused threatened to quit the team after that allegation.</p><p>His lack of opportunities in Spain denied him much success that he potentially could achieve, with the talent that he has, according to many football pundits</p><p>. On 20 August 2019, Cypriot First Division club AC Omonia announced the signing of he for one year.</p><p>Then, he returned to Spain on 25 September 2020, after agreeing to a contract with Deportivo La Coruña, recently relegated to the third tier.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-84127 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Miku-on-the-football-field.jpg alt=Miku width=650 height=545 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-84127 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Miku on the football field (Source: Instagram)</p><h2><span id=Miku_8211_Net_Worth_2023>Miku – Net Worth 2023</span></h2><p>The football player has contributed and achieved a lot.
