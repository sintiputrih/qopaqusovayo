Emperor Nero was a big fan of the drink, which was made by soaking roasted dung in vinegar.</span><span class=credit>Wikmedia Commons</span> <span class=caption-body><a href=# rel=noopener>Phallic art</a> was extremely common in Ancient Rome.

There would be two men on each seesaw, and while one hung 15 feet up in the air, the other would be stuck down on the ground with the lions.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span> <span class=caption-body>The Romans sometimes used urine to whiten their teeth. The ammonia in urine acted as a stain remover.</span><span class=credit>Public Domain</span> <span class=caption-body>Flamingo tongue was a delicacy devoured by Roman emperors. It was often served alongside pheasant brains, parrotfish livers, and lamprey guts.</span><span class=credit>Public Domain</span> <span class=caption-body>Julius Caesar was never emperor of Rome.

While Roman plumbing and hygiene is widely praised as superior to what followed in the medieval period, research shows that unclean Roman bathhouses and toilets were havens for parasites.</span><span class=credit>Flickr</span> <span class=caption-body>There were female gladiators. By the first century A.D., the practice was common among both slaves forced to fight and female citizens who did so of their own free will.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span> <span class=caption-body>Many Roman emperors knowingly poisoned themselves on a daily basis. They drank a concoction called mithridatium, which contained small amounts of known poisons, foolishly hoping that it would eventually all but immunize them against those poisons in the event of an assassination attempt.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span> <span class=caption-body>Roman charioteers earned more money than the best-paid athletes of today. Experts estimate that, when adjusted for inflation, some charioteers' fortunes were as much as 15 times greater than those of today's wealthiest athletes.</span><span class=credit>Public Domain</span> <span class=caption-body>Ancient Romans celebrated a festival called Saturnalia during which slaves and masters would sometimes switch places.

When fighting the Goths in present-day Bulgaria in 251 A.D., he and his army suffered a brutal defeat because they'd gotten stuck.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span> <span class=caption-body>In about 67 A.D., Emperor Nero married a boy named Sporus, had him castrated, treated him as a woman, and referred to him by the name of his deceased wife, Sabina.

As schoolchildren, we learn all sorts of Ancient Rome facts that leave our minds brimming with visions of emperors, legionnaires, and gladiators that called this revered civilization home.</p><p>There are a few details, however, that most of our teachers were too polite to mention when presenting this idealized image of Rome. So we picture the Colosseum without the smell of blood, the legions without the sweat and mud, and the emperors without the fresh glimmer of urine on their teeth.</p><h2>The Land Before Hygiene</h2><p>Your teacher surely never told you that last fact about Roman dental care, but that's one of those Ancient Rome facts that really brings the history alive. Indeed, in some parts of Ancient Rome, people kept their smiles shimmering with a daily scrubbing of <a href=# rel=noopener>urine</a>.</p><p>And this is just one of many Ancient Rome facts that few seem to know. We hear story after story about gladiators and emperors, for example, but nobody ever talks about the fact that some Romans liked to wear <a href=# rel=noopener>metal-winged penises</a> around their necks for good luck.</p><p>We hear story after story about Roman wars and conquests, but we never hear about the troubles of the common people. Few know of their daily concerns, like whether the last person to use the <a href=# rel=noopener>communal poop sponge</a> had really cleaned it properly, or whether a parasitic worm was climbing through your toilet.</p><h2>Families That Were A Little Too Close</h2><p>And we likewise seldom hear about the close family connections that were so important to the Romans, like the story of <a href=# rel=noopener>Emperor Carcalla</a>, who comforted his mother when his brother died by reminding her that, if she cried, he'd kill her next.</p><p>Nor do we hear much about the families that grew a little too close for comfort. Consider the story of Emperor Claudius, whose devotion to his family ran so deep that he changed the very laws of Rome so that he could marry his niece.</p><p>We might hear about Emperor Nero, but rarely do we hear the love story between him and his wife, Sabina. He loved her so dearly that, when she died, he castrated a young boy, brought him to his bedroom, and made him pretend to be his dead wife.</p><h2>The Ancient Rome Facts That Nobody Shares</h2><p>And it's a shame that facts like these seldom get repeated because the image of Rome we're otherwise left with is simply incomplete.</p><p>As so often when happens when looking backward into history, we see Rome as a mirror of our own time. We look into history and see the people we are today, dressed up in togas and armor but otherwise more or less the same. But we first must understand just how far off that image really is.</p><p>Ancient Rome was a part of the ancient world. It was a different country in a different time and a different place. They had their own unique sets of beliefs and ideas. They lived completely different lives from our own and saw the world in completely different ways — more different than you likely ever expected.</p><p>Check out the gallery of Ancient Rome facts above for yourself and see how just how unusual <a href=# rel=noopener>this storied civilization</a> could truly be.</p><p>Next, check out these little-known <a href=#>facts about Ancient Egypt</a>, and learn about the strange <a href=#>history of the ancient world</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyiusKinKesXae8rrGMn5icrKM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fancient-rome-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fancient-rome-facts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fancient-rome-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fancient-rome-facts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fancient-rome-facts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fancient-rome-facts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./daughter-of-tracy-nelson-and-william-r-moses.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./daughter-of-tracy-nelson-and-william-r-moses.html>Daughter of Tracy Nelson and William R.
