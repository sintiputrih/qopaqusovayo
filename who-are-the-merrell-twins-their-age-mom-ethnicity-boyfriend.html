<time>04 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>The world of Youtube content creators can be quite competitive and daunting, especially if you’re planning on making a career out of it, but the Merrell twins seem to have cracked the code to success as Youtube vloggers.&nbsp;The Merrell twins are identical twin sisters, Veronica and Vanessa, who jointly run a Youtube channel with over 3.5 million subscribers and over 641 million views.</span></p><p><span>Their videos mostly focus on fun topics like as well as showcasing their singing skills.&nbsp;Due to their fame on Youtube thanks to their amazing singing skills, they have featured in TV shows like&nbsp;</span><span>Fake It</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Jane the Virgin.&nbsp;</span><span>More interesting information about their career, family and personal life below.</span></p><h2><strong><span>The Merrell Twins – Biography, Age</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Merrell twins consisting of Veronica Jo Merelle and Vanessa Merell, were born in Kansas City, Missouri on August 6, 1996. Veronica, the older of the two, was born normal with no complications.&nbsp;Vanessa, on the other hand, proved difficult to deliver, leading her mother to opt for an urgent caesarean on the advice of her doctor.</span></p><p><span>Due to this complication, Vanessa was therefore born 45 minutes later than her older sister Veronica.&nbsp;Moreso, it was discovered that Vanessa was not breathing properly due to lung issues.&nbsp;Therefore, she was quickly placed in intensive care until she fully recovered.</span></p><p><span>The sisters have always been in love with music. As long as they can remember, the entertainment industry started learning music from the age of five and now play the violin, piano and guitar very well.&nbsp;In 6th grade, the Merrell twins made a scary video but never uploaded it for fear people would say they looked stupid in the video.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Success on YouTube, acting, education</span></strong></h2><p><span>In 2009, with the help of their father”, they were able to create their own YouTube channel as well as their first video called “What it’s like to be a twin”.&nbsp;Once the video was created and uploaded, they never checked it for more than two years.&nbsp;By the time they checked again, they were amazed to find that the video had over 10,000 views with over 2,000 subscribers.&nbsp;Seeing this, the twin became very motivated to post more videos, uploading comedy sketches along with their music.</span></p><p><span>They quickly became the creative directors of “WeHeart It” and also entered into a partnership with “YouNow”.&nbsp;So far, their father, Paul, is the one who produces and edits their videos with contents such as;&nbsp;fun games, challenges, original songs, covers and sketches.&nbsp;The Merrell twins boast of having over 641 million views in their video and over 3.5 million subscribers who love their work.</span></p><p><span>To take it a step further and pursue a career, the Merrel twins moved to Los Angeles with their parents when they were 16, a move that would later prove beneficial for them.&nbsp;Due to their growing popularity and success on YouTube, they have been offered roles in a number of films and television shows, including:&nbsp;</span><i><span>Jane the Virgin</span></i><span>&nbsp;as well as the 2016 film&nbsp;</span><i><span>Arm Wrestling</span></i><span>.&nbsp;Moreso, their ambition to work extensively in Hollywood made them think about getting professional training and skills.&nbsp;Currently, Vanessa is studying as a television producer while Veronica runs a screenwriter program.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family – dad, mom, ethnicity</span></strong></h2><p><span>In terms of ethnicity, the Merrell twins are most certainly the Americans who come from a small, close-knit family.&nbsp;Their father, Paul Merrell, is a video producer and musician who has been very helpful and supportive of his twins’ vlogging career.&nbsp;Their beloved mother, Wendy, is also supportive of her daughters, even though she works as a school secretary.&nbsp;The Merrel twins are their parents’ only children as they have no other siblings.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Boyfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Merrell twins have been quite vocal when it comes to relationships to the point of chatting freely on their Youtube pages.&nbsp;But they haven’t really been involved in a lot of relationships considering their age.&nbsp;However, Vanessa Merrell, the younger of the twins, was in a relationship with Instagram and YouTube star Aaron Van Wormer in 2016. Unfortunately, the two are no longer an item and Aaron went on to strike up a new relationship with Courtney Oddo in 2017</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6or7EZquhnV2isrO%2BxKWjZqynnru0edOhnKKqXZa0pnnMqKRmnaSdu6qvyK2wZpqfrrOztcSnm2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-the-merrell-twins-their-age-mom-ethnicity-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-are-the-merrell-twins-their-age-mom-ethnicity-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-the-merrell-twins-their-age-mom-ethnicity-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-are-the-merrell-twins-their-age-mom-ethnicity-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-the-merrell-twins-their-age-mom-ethnicity-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-the-merrell-twins-their-age-mom-ethnicity-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./charles-johnsons-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./charles-johnsons-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Charles Johnsons Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./stephanie-sigman.html>Stephanie Sigman</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./stephanie-sigman.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
