The game received rave reviews and became nominated for Game of the Year honors. That game led to a sequel called Horizon Forbidden West which follows Aloy and her aims to figure out the source of the machine world they are currently living in. Based on a report we wrote a year ago, and from our <a href=#>trusted and proven source</a>, we can now confirm that Horizon Zero Dawn is being turned into a live-action <a href=#>show </a>for Netflix.</p><p>Our <a href=#>initial report</a> had been that Horizon Zero Dawn was being turned into a movie, but it appears as if Sony has changed things and is now turning the movie into a live-action <a href=#>series</a>, either way, we are set to be seeing a possibly live-action version of Aloy. There is no telling in which direction Sony and Netflix are planning to take his newly announced series, as the world of Horizon is big enough to explore many different plots. Rost is Aloy’s mentor in the first game, and his backstory might be one that the show could explore further. The whole idea of the outcast dynamic in the game could be one that the show could focus on as well.</p><p>Horizon Zero Dawn was released in 2017 and has since sold over 20 million units as of November 2021. The game still holds an 89/100 Metacritic score and was heralded as one of the best and most original games when it had been released. The idea that the world is now being dominated by machines, but society has reverted to tribal culture is fascinating. This story was captivating enough to now see a partnership between Sony and Netflix take place. Horizon now joins the likes of God of War, The Last of Us, Twisted Metal, and Ghost of Tsushima as being <a href=#>converted </a>into a film or TV series. God of War has been announced as a series on Amazon as well. Both were announced as part of an investor’s meeting at Sony.</p><p>Sony is clearly seeing the value of taking some of its most popular IPs and turning them into more expansive stories that exist beyond their game iterations. The Last of Us is currently the most far along in terms of debuting, as the HBO show has been in development for quite some time. The series is set to debut sometime in 2023 and see Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey take on the roles of Joel and Ellie. Twisted Metal has been announcing a cast recently that includes Anthony Mackie, Stephanie Beatriz, Neve Campbell, and Thomas Haden Church. Ghost of Tsushima and God of War has no further updates yet.</p><p>Horizon Zero Dawn has a rich backstory and plot that can be explored in many ways, but it is interesting to see how they plan to portray the post-apocalyptic robotic world that Horizon is known for. There is no further information about if Aloy will be the protagonist of the series, or if they plan to follow a prequel story of sorts. Either way, this show is going to be interesting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ign6e2u7vNZrGeqp9isaLDzWaqnqqZmsBur86nnaKqnZqxb7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhorizon-zero-dawn-series-confirmed-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhorizon-zero-dawn-series-confirmed-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhorizon-zero-dawn-series-confirmed-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhorizon-zero-dawn-series-confirmed-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhorizon-zero-dawn-series-confirmed-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhorizon-zero-dawn-series-confirmed-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./crystal-meth-carrying-pigeon.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./crystal-meth-carrying-pigeon.html>Pigeon Caught In Canada Carrying Crystal Meth Into Prison</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./indiana-brewery-offensive-beer-names.html>Indiana Brewery's List Of Offensive Beer Names Dropped Following Heavy Scrutiny</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./indiana-brewery-offensive-beer-names.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
