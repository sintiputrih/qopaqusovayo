This article is about her family members if she had done any surgeries, her height, and her dating history.</p><p>We cover it all so learn more as you scroll down this article.</p><h3><strong>Anna-May Robey On Love Island 2023</strong></h3><p>One candidate from Swansea will be on the ITV show Love Island when it returns to our screens on Monday. With nine other hopefuls, Anna-May Robey is joining the South African villa. The program smashed records last summer by being the most-watched series on the ITV Hub, with more than 269 million views, and is currently airing its ninth series on ITV2 and for the first time on ITVX.</p><p>About why she joined the show, Anna explained, “I’ve been single for quite a while my mother is bugging me, she’s like, ‘You need to find a boyfriend.’ I’m just excited to try something new and I think going on Love Island is a good way to meet someone.”</p><p>Anna described herself as “funny, energetic and spontaneous” and will bring lots of fun to the villa. “I’ll bring energy to the Villa, I’ll get everyone up playing games!”, she told ITV2.</p><p>Talking about her icks, she explained, “Watching a boy get his haircut and the barber pushing up the seat, you know the pumping thing? I used to go to the barber with my ex and I used to sit there and every time the barber would do it, I would have to look away.”</p><p>Anna-May’s dream dinner would have guests like Anthony Joshua, Ricky Gervais, and Olly Murs, while Coldplay would make up the soundtrack. “I love Coldplay, I absolutely love them, I’d probably listen to Coldplay forever,” she says.</p><p>Laura Whitmore will be replaced by Maya Jama as the show’s new host in the 2023 season. ITV made the announcement that this year’s candidates will have to suspend their social media accounts last month in order to safeguard themselves, their families, and the cause of good mental health.</p><p>The broadcaster will invite islanders to make their accounts “dormant” for the first time while they are in the villa so that nothing may be published on their behalf and so they can prevent “the negative impacts of social media.” After the most recent series generated thousands of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom, they are also receiving “advice and training” about “mutually respectful behavior in relationships.”</p><h3><strong>Anna-May Robey Dating Status</strong></h3><p class="A8Lwr BVYCX">Though Anna-May Robey was single at the time she entered the villa, she shared about her past dating experience. She added, “I’m also not afraid to get in someone’s way; if I like someone, I’ll let them know.” She added, “I went on a date once and I never saw him again. We went for food and shared a bottle of wine. As I was speaking to him he fell asleep! I had to clink his wine glass to wake him up.”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She explained: “I’ve had a few bad dating experiences. There was one time someone started to fall asleep when we were on a date. I don’t think I’m boring but it was over a meal, that was bad.”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Anna added, “I’ve had another date where someone asked me so many questions like interviewed me ‘what’s your favorite color’ and I’m sat there like ‘I don’t want to be here.” Anna was also in a long-term relationship that ended in September which lasted for nearly five years.</p><p>It’s a fantastic place to start when Anna-May says she wants to leave the villa with a lover. “I want to find someone who makes me laugh,” she says. “I’ve been single for quite a while, my mother is bugging me, she’s like, ‘You need to find a boyfriend.’”</p><p>Anna believes that ber “fussy” and “gets the ick easily” which is the reason why she is single. But, she is always falling for people who aren’t interested in her. She stated, “I become obsessed with someone when they don’t like me. But, when they start giving me the attention that I want I’m not interested anymore.”</p><p>Anna-May’s ideal type and celebrity crush is Anthony Joshua but she won’t say no to “Jamie Dornan as well”.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Anna-May Robey?</strong></h3><p>The youngest contestant in Love Island this season, Anna-May Robey is 20 years old.</p><h3><strong>Anna-May Robey Family</strong></h3><p>Anna-May Robey is the daughter of Paul Robey and Jo Robey. She has a younger brother named Aaron Robey (<a href=#>@aaronrobey6</a>). Aaron turned 18 years old in August 2022. Anna’s paternal grandma is named June Robey.</p><p>She said the longest she’s spent time apart from her parents was a week. Because she works from home, she rarely meets people so she talks to her dad a lot. But before joining the show, her dad made her vow that she won’t be having s*x on national TV.</p><p>“I’m always running around singing and screaming,” Anna-May says. “My parents are always like, ‘Shut up!’”</p><h3><strong>Anna-May Robey Job</strong></h3><p>Anna-May Robey works as a payroll administrator. According to Indeed.com, the average salary for a job in Swansea is £22,725 per year.</p><h3><strong>Has Anna-May Robey Undergone Plastic Surgery?</strong></h3><p>Anna-May Robey revealed to DailyMail that she had a boob job months before she entered the South Africa villa. She told the paper that enhancing the size of her breasts is “one of the best things I’ve done” after it boosted her confidence.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She told DailyMail, “I just had a boob job a couple of months ago. It’s one of the best things I’ve done. It has really boosted my confidence. I was never really insecure before but it was something I was a tiny bit insecure about. I’ve had a bit of lip filler too. It’s not something I was insecure about before I just did it to enhance my lips when I’m wearing lipstick.”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Anna-May added, “If anyone wanted to get it done and speak to me I would say really think about it first. It’s not going to change your life or make you a million percent happier but obviously if it’s going to boost your confidence then get it done if not then don’t get it done and I wouldn’t tell people to get it done either.”</p><p>She revealed that she was insecure about her chest and had done plastic surgery but warns any person considering going under the knife that it won’t make them a “million percent happier.”</p><h3><strong>Anna-May Robey Height</strong></h3><p>Love Island star Anna-May Robey stands tall at the height above 5’7.5”.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Anna-May Robey Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Anna-May Robey’s birthday is not available at the moment.
