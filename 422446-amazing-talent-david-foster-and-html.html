Rennie's appearance, shared by his mother in a video on Instagram, marked a captivating family moment on stage, impressing audiences and hinting at a promising musical future.</p><p class=Zg>In a delightful showcase of emerging talent, Katharine McPhee and David Foster's son, Rennie, at just 3 years old, captured the hearts of fans during a performance on stage at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., on February 25.</p><p class=Zg>The celebrated musical duo introduced their son to the stage, where he joined them and showcased his talent for playing the drums.</p><p class=Zg>McPhee took to Instagram to share this special occurrence, <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/C30nY3dP0Yv/>captioning</a> the video, "had a VERY special guest join us on stage for the first time ü•Å #ProudMom."</p><p class=Zg>In the video, lasting just over 30 seconds, Rennie is seen playing the drums with vigor as his father plays the piano and McPhee moves to the rhythm of "St. Elmo‚Äôs Fire (Man in Motion)."</p><p class=Zg>Despite Rennie's apparent involvement with the drums, the <a class="zd d" href=#>"American Idol"</a> alum was quick to clarify the reality behind the adorable performance. In a candid revelation in the comments section, she <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/C30nY3dP0Yv/>explained</a>:</p><p class=Zg>"By the way‚Ä¶ I hope people realize that JR -the legend-@johnjrrobinson1 -our incredible drummer is drumming & Rennie is only copying to the best of his ability unmic‚Äôd- and it was cute to watch his first on stage debut."</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Katharine McPhee and David Foster at the 2024 MusiCares Person of the Year gala at the LA Convention Center in Los Angeles on February 2, 2024 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>The clip has since become a hit among fans, <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/C30nY3dP0Yv/>praising</a> the couple‚Äôs "<i class=Yg>child prodigy.</i>" One person wrote, <i class=Yg>"Omg he‚Äôs too good I can‚Äôt deal.

Stop it right now this is the most precious thing I have seen</i>."</p><p class=Zg>Fans also acknowledged the source of Rennie's talent. Addressing McPhee, one <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/C30nY3dP0Yv/>wrote</a>, "<i class=Yg>Amazing talent!</i> <i class=Yg>He's clearly inherited both of your musical dominant genes!</i>" Meanwhile, another fan <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/C30nY3dP0Yv/>conveyed</a>, ‚Äú<i class=Yg>I love it......Mommy sidestage cheering on her future star Rennie Foster!</i>"</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Katharine McPhee performing on Season 4 of "American Idol" | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>Rennie's drumming aptitude had already made waves before this recent performance. In January, his mother uploaded a TikTok video revealing his musical flair.</p><p class=Zg>In the clip, Rennie energetically drums to Michael Jackson's "Rock With You" on his personalized red drum set. On the sidelines, his father observes with amusement, offering guidance at moments.</p><p class=Zg>In the text overlaying the video, McPhee <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tiktok.com/@katharinefoster/video/7320764422429936927>reveals</a>, "my 2-year-old baby is a genius." She then guides the camera through a hallway to the room where Rennie is playing the drums.</p><p class=Zg>Dressed in a gray T-shirt and sporting headphones, Rennie is fully immersed, masterfully keeping pace with the King of Pop's rhythm. Foster, clearly enjoying the scene, nods in sync with the beat.</p><p class=Zg>Rennie had just turned three last week, and the family marked this special occasion with a <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/C3qX9wXPiZz/>trip to Disney World</a>, an event McPhee captured and shared on Instagram.</p><p class=Zg>She revealed that they ventured on as many rides as possible, thoroughly enjoying themselves, except one ride that left them feeling queasy.</p><p class=Zg>McPhee was pleasantly surprised by Rennie's bravery when meeting Mickey Mouse; he wasn't the least bit scared and even high-fived the iconic character, while she managed an awkward hug. Moreover, she highlighted a pianist whose performance earned Foster's nod of approval.</p><p class=Zg>Their culinary adventures were also featured, including the delectable pastries they indulged in. A memorable moment during their meal was Rennie pretending to play the drums with a pair of straws, a playful act his father happily joined in on.</p><p class=Zg>Rennie‚Äôs journey into the spotlight at just three years old offers more than just a glimpse of his emerging talent. It opens a window into the distinct parenting approaches of his parents.</p><p class=Zg>Despite their harmonious life, the couple faces differences in <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/katharine-mcphee-and-david-foster-disagree-about-disciplining-son-8405880>their parenting styles</a>, shaped by the generational gap between them.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>David Foster and Katharine McPhee at the press night after-party for "Waitress: The Musical" on March 7, 2019, in London, England | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>Foster, who already has five grown-up children, prefers a traditional way of disciplining. He thinks it's time to start setting rules for Rennie, but McPhee doesn't fully agree. She believes in a gentler approach, focusing on patience and understanding instead of punishment like time-outs.</p><p class=Zg>‚ÄúMy take is that you can have more mindful parenting opposed to just assuming that a two or three-year-old can have time alone to reflect on what they've done poorly," McPhee <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/katharine-mcphee-and-david-foster-disagree-about-disciplining-son-8405880>revealed</a> in November.</p><p class=Zg>Their different approaches on how to discipline their child, with McPhee describing Foster‚Äôs as ‚Äúresults-based,‚Äù don't cause fights between them. Instead, they respect each other's opinions.</p><p class=Zg>McPhee sees discipline as something they should do together, slowly, as Rennie grows. She thinks it's important for Rennie to learn about personal space and how to behave from interacting with others outside the family, like teachers and classmates.</p><p class=Zg>Their story, alongside Rennie's early steps into music, highlights how they're working to bring him up as a kind and well-rounded person. Despite their different methods, their main goal is to raise Rennie with love, respect, and patience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1pa2xka3qiucCzoKefXamurbHNrWSdmaaesW6yzqyrnqpdlrulesetpKU%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f422446-amazing-talent-david-foster-and-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f422446-amazing-talent-david-foster-and-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f422446-amazing-talent-david-foster-and-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f422446-amazing-talent-david-foster-and-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f422446-amazing-talent-david-foster-and-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f422446-amazing-talent-david-foster-and-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-anandtech-coffee-lake-review-8700k-and-8400-initial-numbers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-anandtech-coffee-lake-review-8700k-and-8400-initial-numbers.html>Initial Numbers on the Core i7-8700K and Core i5-8400</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./azja-pryor.html>Azja Pryor Bio, Age, Single, Nationality, Height, Net Worth, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./azja-pryor.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
