GEORGIA WINS.</strong></p><p><strong>11:59 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Stroud gets in trouble, chased out of the pocket but he's able to get away and heave it out of bounds. 8 seconds with the field goal attempt coming.</p><p><strong>11:58 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Buckeyes take a shot with a pass, it gets deflected up but no one around for UGA to pull down the pick. 15 seconds.</p><p><strong>11:57 p.m. |</strong> Buckeyes seem about content with their field position at this point. No yards on a first down run, Dawgs take timeout.</p><p><strong>11:54 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Dawgs collapse the pocket... but Stroud breaks out, runs to the UGA 30. That'll put OSU in field goal range with 24 seconds to go.</p><p><strong>11:53 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Stroud completes one to about the 45. 39 seconds on the clock as UGA has another injury pause.</p><p><strong>11:52 p.m. |</strong> Look back at that TD:</p><p><strong>11:51 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Dawgs get pressure on Stroud, he scrambles for about five yards. An injured Dawg stops the clock though. 39 seconds to go for OSU from their own 30.</p><p><strong>11:50 p.m. |</strong> Touchback on the kickoff. Ohio State, crucially, doesn't need to go down the whole field. A field goal would win it for them.</p><p><strong>11:48 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>PAT is good. 42-41 Georgia with 54 seconds to go.</p><p><strong>11:47 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>TOUCHDOWN DAWGS. 10 YARDS TO ADONAI MITCHELL. 41-41 tie ball game with the PAT to come!!</p><p><strong>11:46 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>MASSIVE completion from Bennett down to the 15.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>11:46 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Too many men on the field for OSU on that last play, five yards to Georgia. Lined up at the 50 with 1:49 to go.</p><p><strong>11:45 p.m. |</strong> Bennett just&nbsp;avoids getting sacked and hits Bowers downfield at the 45.</p><p><strong>11:42 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Big field goal for the Buckeyes though. Dawgs will need a touchdown.</p><p><strong>11:42 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Dawgs get pressure, Stroud throws it away and it'll bring up fourth down with just a little less than three minutes left.</p><p><strong>11:41 p.m. |</strong> Massive sack for UGA on second down.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>11:38 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Buckeyes almost certain to get a field goal out of this possession. A touchdown would seemingly just about do it. And that's if they don't simply run out the clock.</p><p><strong>11:37 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Huge blow to the Dawgs: On a 3rd and 8 with about 5:30 to go, Stroud connects for the first down.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>11:30 p.m. |</strong> Yeah, Smith was very, very, very open on that TD:</p><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2ltRD3Oj4m</a></p>— Reggie Chatman Jr. (@ReggieChatman) <a href=#>January 1, 2023</a><p><strong>11:28 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Bennett to Bowers for the two point conversion is good! 38-35.</p><p><strong>11:27 p.m. |</strong> Holy MOLY. Bennett hits a wide&nbsp;open Arian Smith for a 76-yard touchdown on the first play of the drive.</p><p><strong>11:26 p.m. |</strong> OSU actually punts this time. UGA will start at about their own 25.</p><p><strong>11:23 p.m. |</strong> Incredible. Buckeyes punt unit came out, ran a fake and picked up the yardage.... only Kirby Smart had called a timeout before the play.</p><p><strong>11:22 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>UGA needed a three-and-out, and it looks like they just may have gotten it. Stroud broke for a run on third down and was taken down just shy of a first down.</p><p><strong>11:15 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>In a very&nbsp;disjointed trip to the red zone, a botched screen turned into a fumble which UGA recovered, then Bennett threw into tight coverage on third down for an incompletion. Dawgs take three points, 38-27.</p><p><strong>11:13 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Per our reporters in the stadium, it WILL be a first down:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>FIRST DOWN GEORGIA. FIRST DOWN GEORGIA.</p>— Maria Martin (@Ria_Martin) <a href=#>January 1, 2023</a><p><strong>11:11 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>They are gonna review this for the spot. Replay didn't make it look like it'll be an entirely clear call.</p><p><strong>11:10 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Georgia goes for it on fourth and 6, a completion to Bowers comes up inches short.</p><p><strong>11:07 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Big completion to Brock Bowers has UGA in striking distance at about the OSU 20.</p><p><strong>11:02 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Dawgs pick up a first down on a screen for McIntosh to start their drive, time winds down on the third quarter.</p><p><strong>11:00 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Buckeyes do connect on the field goal, making it 38-24.</p><p><strong>10:59 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Looks like they'll actually avoid the penalty here after a review. Massive for the Dawgs:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Javon Bullard not called for targeting. It'll bring up 4th down.</p>— Maria Martin (@Ria_Martin) <a href=#>January 1, 2023</a><p><strong>10:58 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>In one of the more baffling plays you'll ever see, UGA DB Javon Bullard takes a targeting penalty looking to break up a potential touchdown catch at the very back of the end zone on a pass by Stroud that was essentially a prayer of a heave, with about four Bulldogs bearing down on him.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>10:52 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Stroud airs it out and UGA takes another really bad pass interference penalty. They are really struggling with the Buckeyes' aerial threat - very uncharacteristic for what's been a very strong Georgia secondary this season.</p><p><strong>10:47 p.m. |</strong> Two rushing plays that gain negligible yardage and a sack of Bennett leaves UGA with a long field goal attempt that Jack Podlesny can't hit. Score remains 35-24 OSU. Rough night for Podlesny, who's now 1-for-3 on attempts.</p><p><strong>10:44 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>And they do wind up with nice field position. A solid little return by Kearis Jackson from a bit past the 50 gets the Georgia drive started on OSU's 32.</p><p><strong>10:43 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Stroud airs it out on 3rd and long from about the 5, after a sack, and he nearly connected - but luckily for the Dawgs it slips past the fingers of the receiver and they'll get the ball back on a punt. Should have pretty good field position.</p><p><strong>10:40 p.m. |</strong> Another flat drive for the Dawgs, and OSU takes over at the 10 after a punt.</p><p><strong>10:30 p.m. |</strong> It looked in that moment UGA came back and took the lead that it would mean they'd start running away with things, but that definitely is not the case: Stroud marches OSU downfield again, lobs one in for a touchdown, and it's 35-24 Buckeyes.</p><p><strong>10:25 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Not much going for UGA on the first drive of the second half. Punting back to US.</p><p><strong>10:13 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>There's also this nugget:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kirby tells ESPN’s Laura Rutledge he told Stetson to settle down. “We are gonna need him to win it, so he’s gotta know to throw it and catch it.”</p>— Maria Martin (@Ria_Martin) <a href=#>January 1, 2023</a><p><strong>10:12 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Some halftime observations from our reporters Maria Martin and Reggie Chatman:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Halftime<br>Ohio State 28-24.<br>CJ Stroud 15-19 for 238 yards and 3 TDs<br>Stetson Bennett 12-18 191 yards 1 TD, 1 INT<br>238 of Ohio State’s 248 yards are through the air.

It's been the CJ Stroud show and boy has he delivered.</p>— Reggie Chatman Jr. (@ReggieChatman) <a href=#>January 1, 2023</a><p><strong>9:58 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>UGA takes a couple shots at getting downfield, both incomplete, and they'll take the four-point deficit into halftime.</p><p><strong>9:55 p.m. |</strong> As noted earlier, Kirby Smith identified line play as a real key for this game earlier in the week, and C.J. Stroud has just had a ton of time for the most part.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>9:55 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>OSU quick-strikes in return to get the lead back themselves, a 37-yard TD pass to a wide open Xavier Johnson. Buckeyes back on top 27-24.</p><p><strong>9:51 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>UGA drive stalls out, but they convert the field goal this time and retake the lead, 24-21.</p><p><strong>9:45 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>An illegal motion penalty ruined OSU's 4th down attempt, and Bennett hits Marcus Rosemy-Jacksaint on 2nd down of the new drive over the middle for a gain to the OSU 35.</p><p><strong>9:40 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Big 3rd and 1 stop for the Dawgs, looks like OSU will go for it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>9:35 p.m. |</strong> McIntosh's stumble winds up not mattering, as Stetson scampers in for the score. 21-20 and it's a whole new ball game for the Dawgs!</p><p><strong>9:35 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>First play of the drive, Kenny McIntosh finds a big hole and was well on his way to a TD before he tripped at about the 15.</p><p><strong>9:30 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Huge third down sack by Mykel Williams, and the Buckeyes will be punting back to the Dawgs with a lot of time still left in the half.</p><p><strong>9:20 p.m. |</strong> Just when UGA looks a bit out of sorts with Bennett taking an odd penalty on an illegal forward pass, the quarterback hits Arian Smith on a long pass to the 10 and then Kendall Milton brings it in for a touchdown. Dawgs back in it! 21-13.</p><p><strong>9:14 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>C.J. Stroud evades about three UGA defenders and fires in a touchdown pass from about 15 yards out. 21-7 Buckeyes.</p><p><strong>9:10 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Stetson Bennett makes a rushed throw on the first play of the new drive right into the arms of an OSU defensive back. Disastrous turnover has the Buckeyes on the Georgia 30.</p><p><strong>9:08 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Buckeyes punch it in. 13-7.</p><p><strong>9:04 p.m. |</strong> A really unfortunate pass interference call for the Dawgs gets OSU to the 2-yard line.</p><p><strong>9:00 p.m. |</strong> Dawgs almost get a chance to recover a fumble after Kelee Ringo knocks the ball out of Marvin Harrison's hands on an OSU completion, but a couple UGA defenders run into each other and knock the loose ball out of the sideline.</p><p><strong>8:57 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>7-7 after UGA converts the PAT, but Ohio State now mounting another drive into Dawgs territory as Stroud has completed three straight passes with time expiring on the first quarter.</p><p><strong>8:44 p.m. |</strong> Kenny McIntosh takes a screen to the house and it's 7-6.</p><p><strong>8:42 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>A big run and a rollout passing play from Bennett to Brock Bowers has Georgia knocking on the door at the OSU 18.</p><p><strong>8:40 p.m. |</strong> Bennett hits Dominick Blaylock for 20 yards and a fresh set of downs. When Stetson throws, good things tend to be happening for UGA.</p><p><strong>8:39 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Another broken rushing play has UGA facing 2nd and 17 as they try to respond.</p><p><strong>8:37 p.m. |</strong> Kirby Smart said this week the key to this game would be to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">win the battle at the line of scrimmage</a>... Dawgs certainly did not do that on that scoring play for Ohio State.</p><p><strong>8:35 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Stroud hits Marvin Harrison Jr. for a 31-yard TD. The QB had a lot of time, rolled to his right as the pocket broke down and found Harrison open in the end zone.</p><p><strong>8:33 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>C.J. Stroud gets going for the Buckeyes - back to back completions of 10+ yards for first downs. Ohio State into Georgia territory.</p><p><strong>8:30 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Bennett and the Dawgs had been humming on that drive - the QB was 4/5 for 48 yards. But nothing to show for it so far.</p><p><strong>8:28 p.m. |</strong> UGA gets solidly into Ohio State territory, but a 3rd and 1 scramble by Stetson Bennett gets stopped well short of a first down. Dawgs then shank the field goal, game stays 0-0.</p><p><strong>8:25 p.m. |&nbsp;</strong>Big sack on third down by Smael Mondon for the Dawgs, one of the standout defensive players who have stepped up as a team leader after the team lost an unprecedented amount of defensive talent to the NFL Draft.
