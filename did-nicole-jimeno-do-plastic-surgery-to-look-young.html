As Pedro’s younger sister, she has undergone a significant transformation since her initial appearance on “90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way,” where she was introduced as his dramatic younger sibling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/arMF1_YOs/0x0/nicole-jimeno-orange-sleeveless-shirt-1683653951394.jpg><p>While Nicole has maintained a consistent personality, she has invested a substantial amount of money in altering her appearance. Despite the turbulence in her love life, Nicole has embraced her reality TV stardom and, driven by her aspiration to participate in beauty pageants, has diligently worked over the past few years to achieve her desired look. This dedication has sparked curiosity among many fans about the procedures she has undergone.</p><p>One of the most noticeable changes in Pedro’s sister’s appearance is her breast augmentation, a transformation she revealed during Season 3 of “The Family Chantel.” During the show, she shared her new breasts with her best friend, Coraima Morla. Despite opposition from her on-again, off-again boyfriend Alejandro Padron, she proceeded with the treatment during their time apart.</p><p>In recent episodes of “The Family Chantel,” Nicole’s appearance has continued to evolve, and she appears content with the results, confidently showcasing her new figure in online images. Her openness about the work done extends to the TLC show, where she disclosed the use of Botox injections to address her weak chin, resulting in a more defined jawline.</p><p>While some fans of “The Family Chantel” have speculated about additional fillers in her face, it’s essential to consider the impact of factors like lighting, filters, and angles on images. Despite varied opinions, viewers have suggested that Nicole’s cosmetic and plastic surgery procedures have led her to resemble Chantel Everett more closely.</p><h2>Nicole Jimeno Relationship Timeline</h2><p>Although Nicole Jimeno does not seem to be in a formal relationship on “The Family Chantel,” her love life is still filled with interesting developments. The lingering question revolves around her tumultuous relationship with Alejandro Padron, prompting speculation about the possibility of giving him another chance.</p><p>One significant obstacle to the couple’s reconciliation is the apparent lack of complete approval from both Pedro Jimeno and Nicole’s mother, Lidia Morel, who have openly expressed their disapproval in the past.</p><p>Despite these challenges, it appears that Nicole is still in communication with Alejandro, suggesting that their relationship may not be entirely over. In Season 5, Nicole discovers Karen Everett’s alleged attempts to disrupt Pedro’s immigration process with Alejandro. Reportedly, Chantel Everett’s mother traveled to New York to discuss Nicole’s family with him, but he declined the conversation.</p><p>Alejandro later shared this information with Nicole. When Pedro questioned Nicole about why Alejandro refused to speak with Karen, she suggested that it might be because she still holds hope for a possible reconciliation between them. While this indicates that Nicole and Alejandro are no longer a couple, it also reveals that she maintains contact with her former partner.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Is Jordan Lloyd Pregnant Or Weight Gain?
