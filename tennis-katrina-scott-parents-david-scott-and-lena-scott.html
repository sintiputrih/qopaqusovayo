David and Lena Scott are the parents.</h2><p>At the age of 19, Katrina Scott aspires to be a tennis player.

She had tough opponents in her game.</p><p>Even though Katrina’s family is from Los Angeles, she moved to Columbus, Ohio, to train at the Kass Academy with instructor David Kass.</p><p>Lean Scott, Katrina’s mother, went to the US Open with her daughter. She conveyed her delight and joy at her daughter’s accomplishments.</p><h2>Katrina Scott: Ascent to the Top In the US Open</h2><p>Katrina Scott arrived at the US Open with a spectacular performance, swiftly filling in the blanks in her story.</p><p>Scott was reared in Woodland Hills and had an unusual path to the US Open.

She defeated Russian player Natalia Vikhlyantseva 7-6(3), 6-2.</p><p>In addition, Katrina teamed up with excellent management, which was headed by former professional tennis player Melien Tu.</p><p>Scott has benefited greatly from Tu’s advice and knowledge as she makes her way through the professional tennis scene.</p><p>Scott also had to contend with experienced golfer and 22nd seed Amanda Anisimova. Scott went into the contest with a calm and deliberate attitude.</p><p>She was cool under pressure, but Scott lost the match.
