In 2001, she was arrested for a DUI, before <a href=#>spending a night in jail</a> about three years later, for 'mischief, trespassing, and the harassment of a neighbor.'</p><p>The following year, she was renting space in an apartment owned by fellow actor Michael Rapaport. After a number of complaints from neighbors, the Boston Public star evicted her. The incident would later on come to be the subject of an unaired sketch on <a href=#><strong>Saturday Night Live</strong></a>.</p><p>Similarly, Lyonne has not had a lot of luck when it comes to her love life - or has at least successfully managed to keep most of her romantic experiences away from the public eye.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Natasha Lyonne Reacts To 'Russian Doll' 2020 Time-Loop Viral Tweet</a></span></p><p>Her most high profile <a href=#>relationship was with former SNL star Fred Armisen</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inside-natasha-lyonne-and-fred-armisen-39-s-relationship>Inside Natasha Lyonne And Fred Armisen's Relationship</h2><p>Over the years, Fred Armisen has had a much more overt and public romantic life than Natasha Lyonne. Among others, the Portlandia star has either dated or at least been linked with Martha Plimton, Petra Haden and Abby Elliott.</p><p>He has also been married twice, originally to English musician Sally Timms, and later on to star of The Handmaid's Tale, Elisabeth Moss. The latter lasted only two years, with the actress - who is known for <a href=#>keeping her love life very private</a> - once calling her marriage to Armisen 'traumatic, awful, and horrible.'</p><p>Lyonne and Armisen were first <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumored to be dating</a> in August 2014, when they were spotted together at a post-Emmys event. According to People Magazine, a source at the party reported that the pair 'shared kisses and were very cozy together' that day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pair were originally introduced by Armisen's then co-star on SNL, Maya Rudolph, and their relationship went on to last at least another six years.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Can't Believe Natasha Lyonne Once Appeared In 'Pee Wee's Playhouse'</a></span></p><p>After attending the 2020 Golden Globes as a couple, Lyonne and Armisen were not seen together in public again.

It was then that for the first time, she officially confirmed that the pair had broken up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked whether she still lived in L.A., she revealed that she left the city following her split from Frank Armisen. She also explained the reason why they decided to end things, although as a natural comedian, it was hard to tell whether she was joking about it or not.</p><p>"I honestly think we broke up because I wanted a swimming pool," Lyonne said. "It might seem like a mundane reason for a breakup, but during that pandemic, you’ve got to get your laps — I’m like Burt Lancaster in The Swimmer. So, I got myself a house with a pool."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Big Mouth' Delights Fans With Natasha Lyonne Cameo</a></span></p><p>Lyonne then went on to confirm that she at least remained on cordial terms with Armisen. "We love each other just about as much as two people can love each other, and we’re still talking all the time," she continued. "But Freddy doesn’t like a swimming pool!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-else-has-natasha-lyonne-dated>Who Else Has Natasha Lyonne Dated?</h2><p>Despite her relatively private love life, Natasha Lyonne has been known to be involved with various other people at different points of her life. While she lived in the Michael Rapaport apartment in 2005, there were rumors that there was something brewing between them.</p><p>Those rumors were unsubstantiated, and based on what Rapaport said about her in the aftermath, it doesn't sound like they really stood a chance anyway. "[My apartment] looked like a grenade had gone off," he is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quoted saying by Hollywood.com</a>. "There was garbage everywhere. There were glasses smashed in the kitchen and standing water in the clogged tub with flies hovering over it. That girl needs help."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the late '90s, Lyonne was in a relationship with Detroit Rock City star Edward Furlong, before <a href=#>his fall from grace</a>. They broke up after about one year together, and the actress revealed that they hadn't had an 'insane, intense romance.'</p><p>Lyonne has also been rumored to have had flings with Adam Goldberg and María Celedonio.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Natasha Lyonne's 'But I'm A Cheerleader' Is Becoming A Musical, Here's What We Know</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmppGprrS0wGajsqeeo7Jurc2dZJ%2BqlZl6or7Moqqepl8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-between-natasha-lyonne-and-fred-armisen.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-between-natasha-lyonne-and-fred-armisen.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-natasha-lyonne-and-fred-armisen.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-between-natasha-lyonne-and-fred-armisen.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-natasha-lyonne-and-fred-armisen.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-natasha-lyonne-and-fred-armisen.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mezcala-stone-figures.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mezcala-stone-figures.html>Archaeologists Uncover Looted Stone 'Effigies' At Aztec Site</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./phil-simms-biography-age-wife-son-cbs-nfl-salary-net-worth-stats-2.html>Phil Simms Biography, Age, Wife, Son, CBS, NFL, Salary, Net Worth, Stats</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./phil-simms-biography-age-wife-son-cbs-nfl-salary-net-worth-stats-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
