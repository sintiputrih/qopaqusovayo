The bottom line: The best time to take a probiotic is generally at nighttime before bed.<h2>Do probiotics actually do anything?</h2>Probiotics can aid digestion and help maintain gut health<p>But a growing body of scientific evidence suggests that you can treat and even prevent some illnesses with foods and supplements containing certain kinds of live bacteria.</p><h2>Do probiotics cause herxheimer reaction?</h2>The term 'die-off' is sometimes mentioned in complementary healthcare in relation to side effects from probiotic live cultures.
