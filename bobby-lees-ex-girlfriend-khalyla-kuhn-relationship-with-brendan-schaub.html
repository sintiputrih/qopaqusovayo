In addition to appearing in front of the camera, Lee is also a successful podcaster. He is best known for co-hosting Bad Friends with actor and comedian Andrew Santino and TigerBelly with Khalyla Khun.</p><p>Bobby Lee and Khalyla Khun had been dating for over ten years before they stunned fans by calling it quits. Despite the apparent end of their romantic relationship, they continued with their podcast. However, while the ex-couple tried to move on with their personal and professional lives, people still wanted to know why they had broken up. Soon, cheating allegations and other shocking things about their relationship began to be exposed in the media. Perhaps the most surprising part was that the breakup was partly due to a situation with Bobby Lee's friend, mixed martial artist and podcast host Brendan Schaub.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-bobby-lee-and-khalyla-kuhn-meet-and-start-their-podcast-tigerbelly>How Did Bobby Lee And Khalyla Kuhn Meet And Start Their Podcast TigerBelly?</h2><p>Bobby Lee and Khalyla Kuhn have a colorful history together. The two reportedly met on a dating site many years ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/khalyla-kuhn-1.jpg><p>Despite coming from two different worlds, the most notable difference being Lee having a career in the entertainment industry and Kuhn having a background in biochemistry, the two shared an undeniable chemistry.</p><p>Given their unique backgrounds, it seemed inevitable that the couple would have a successful podcast. However, the real reason they chose to do a podcast together had little to do with that.</p><p>Initially, Lee was supposed to do a podcast with comedian Erik Griffin, but the duo never met to discuss plans further because of a scheduling conflict.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bobby-lee-at-the-premiere-of-it-ends-in-la.jpg><p>At the same time, Lee's podcast plans failed, Khalyla was recuperating after experiencing a significant health struggle.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a report by Distractify</a>, Bobby Lee stated on their podcast that they learned Kuhn had a coronary heart condition during a vacation to the Philippines. Lee then recounted how he had to carry her into a taxi after she had an attack, and how they rushed her to the hospital.</p><p>He added that after that, the ambulance frequented their home at least two to three times a week, and she was often in and out of the hospital. Khalyla said that it was during one of her hospital stays, that she came up with the idea to do a podcast with Lee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/what-bobby-lee-s-ex-wife-khalyla-kuhn-really-thinks-of-brendan-schaub_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Odd Reason Why Fans Think Khalyla Kuhn Used Bobby Lee For Fame</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Some details of Khalyla Kuhn's past, and her own words, have fans thinking she wasn't with Bobby Lee for the right reasons.</span><p>In the TigerBelly podcast, Kuhn and Bobby Lee discuss racism, politics, and entertainment within the Asian American community. It is also a place where the hosts take on other social issues and relevant topics, including light-hearted ones where the two often banter with each other and guests.</p><h2 id=how-bobby-lee-39-s-ex-girlfriend-khalyla-kuhn-came-in-between-his-friendship-with-brendan-schaub>How Bobby Lee's Ex-Girlfriend Khalyla Kuhn Came In Between His Friendship With Brendan Schaub</h2><p>As most regular podcast listeners are already aware, Brendan Schaub not only hosts his podcast show titled The Fighter and the Kid, but he is also a former professional mixed martial artist and stand-up comedian.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bobby-lee-s-ex-girlfriend-khalyla-kuhn-changed-his-relationships-with-brendan-schaub-forever.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Schaub had appeared on Bobby Lee's and Khalyla Kuhn's podcast on several occasions, and Lee had also appeared on Schaub's podcast. The trio were so close that Brendan Schaub said on his show that he considered Lee one of his best friends. Despite their friendship and friendly banter on air, fans couldn't help but notice how flirty Schaub was whenever he spoke to Kuhn.</p><p>The infamous <a href=#>feud between Lee, Kuhn, and Schaub</a> started after defamatory claims were made against the former MMA fighter on Kuhn's other podcast, Trash Tuesday. The episode began when one of the podcast's co-hosts, Annie Lederman, detailed an explicit and troubling experience she had with a male comedian she called B.S.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/bobby-lee.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kuhn then shared her experience with the same comedian, who she claimed had often flirted with her. Khalyla Khun then alleged that B.S. had once sent her an inappropriate text message while she was having a celebratory dinner with her family. In the text, the comedian is supposed to have also asked her if she had any additional plans that evening.</p><p>It was easy for fans to discover that B.S. meant Brendan Schaub. At the time of the supposed flirting and inappropriate text messages, Kuhn was still in a relationship with Lee, and this all happened apparently without his knowledge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite Bobby Lee being the apparent victim of Schaub's alleged betrayal, it was Lee who Schaub decided to take his anger on after Kuhn outed his behavior. Brendan Schaub accused Bobby Lee of orchestrating a coo against him on Reddit to tarnish his name and have him removed from his podcast, which Lee later vehemently denied.</p><p>After several accusations were made from each side, the trio eventually hashed things out on the TigerBelly podcast.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Bobby Lee's Ex-Girlfriend Khalyla Kuhn Really Thinks Of Brendan Schaub?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Khalyla Kuhn has gotten heat since breaking things off with Bobby Lee after the two exposed Brendan Schaub.</span><p>The entire episode centered on Bobby Lee and Brendan Schaub defending themselves while Khalyla was caught awkwardly in the middle.

One such example was that Lee and Kuhn often spoke about how they no longer found each other physically attractive; another was that Lee had once talked about the possibility of them having an open relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZqJqSrnqtscSsZJ6wXZy2s7jFq6CeppRiuKmty7KjmmWbqrWvedGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWSwoaSdeqO%2BxKebmqZdqLCprdSbZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbobby-lees-ex-girlfriend-khalyla-kuhn-relationship-with-brendan-schaub.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbobby-lees-ex-girlfriend-khalyla-kuhn-relationship-with-brendan-schaub.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbobby-lees-ex-girlfriend-khalyla-kuhn-relationship-with-brendan-schaub.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbobby-lees-ex-girlfriend-khalyla-kuhn-relationship-with-brendan-schaub.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbobby-lees-ex-girlfriend-khalyla-kuhn-relationship-with-brendan-schaub.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbobby-lees-ex-girlfriend-khalyla-kuhn-relationship-with-brendan-schaub.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gordon-gund.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gordon-gund.html>Gordon Gund Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10-chilling-true-crime-cases-that-still-remain-unsolved.html>10 chilling true crime cases that still remain unsolved</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10-chilling-true-crime-cases-that-still-remain-unsolved.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
